Internship Coordinator
United Nations Research Institute for Social Development (UNRISD)


Re: Application for Research Internship (Vacancy: Research Internship For the period July–September 2025)

Dear Internship Coordinator,

I am writing to express my keen interest in the Research Internship position at UNRISD for the period July–September 2025, as advertised. With an academic background in Environmental Studies, and practical experience in research and policy analysis, I am enthusiastic about the opportunity to contribute to UNRISD’s work toward the Second World Summit for Social Development.

As a recent graduate from Tribhuvan University, I have conducted extensive research on sustainable development, social equity, and climate resilience—topics that align closely with UNRISD’s mission. During my time as a master's student, I conducted literature reviews, participated in policy roundtables, and assisted in drafting research briefs and presentations for policy stakeholders. These experiences have strengthened my analytical abilities, communication skills, and attention to detail in a dynamic, international environment.

What excites me about this internship is the chance to be directly involved in interdisciplinary research with real-world impact. I am confident in my ability to support policy brief development, fact-check academic outputs, and engage in internal strategic meetings. I am also flexible to attend in-person sessions in Geneva when required, and am fully available for the internship duration.

Thank you for considering my application. I have attached my CV for your review. I would be honored to contribute to UNRISD’s work and look forward to the opportunity to discuss how my background aligns with your team’s needs.

Yours sincerely,
Bishwa Prakash Puri

Statement of Research Interest

I am deeply motivated to pursue research that integrates environmental science with advanced data-driven methodologies such as remote sensing, artificial intelligence, and geospatial analytics. My academic background in Environmental Science (B.Sc. and M.Sc., Tribhuvan University), coupled with professional and academic experience in hydrological modeling, environmental impact assessment, and climate variability analysis, has laid a strong foundation for interdisciplinary research.

My recent work as an Assistant Lecturer in Environmental Modeling (Hydrology) involved teaching advanced modeling tools such as HEC-HMS, HEC-RAS, and SDSM, where I guided graduate students in applying computational methods to hydrological challenges. My ongoing research and publications focus on climate change impacts, soil nutrient dynamics, and agricultural productivity in Nepal, emphasizing the value of spatiotemporal data analysis in addressing real-world environmental problems.

I possess soft programming skills, particularly Python and R, with practical experience in applying libraries such as scikit-learn, GDAL, rasterio and others for environmental data analysis, satial data visualization, along with $\LaTeX$ for report preparation.  Furthermore, my hands-on experience with emission inventory, environmental monitoring, and data-intensive field research complements the vision of Dr. Liu’s lab. I am particularly drawn to projects involving the application of AI and remote sensing to analyze atmospheric phenomena and extreme weather events. I believe that by merging my practical expertise with cutting-edge computational techniques, I can meaningfully contribute to the lab’s efforts to advance environmental resilience.

Joining your research team would allow me to build upon my experience and develop transformative solutions to pressing environmental challenges through data science.

Sincerely,
Bishwa Prakash Puri
