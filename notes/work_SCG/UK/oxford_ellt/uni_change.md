# OELLT Enquiry

Dear Oxford ELLT Team,

I hope this email finds you well. I am writing on behalf of our educational consultancy based in Nepal. We support Nepalese students in pursuing higher education opportunities in the UK and have consistently recommended the Oxford ELLT as a reliable English proficiency test.

However, over the past week, several students have reported issues with scheduling their Speaking test—specifically, the booking system is not displaying available dates. As you can appreciate, timely completion of English proficiency tests is critical for meeting university deadlines.

We would appreciate any guidance or clarification regarding the cause of this issue, and whether there are alternative steps our students can take to complete their Speaking tests.

Thank you for your continued support.

Best regards,
Bishwa Prakash Puri
Business Development Manager

Subject: Mohd Sharik Khan | OIDI Number: 117241 - Request for Listening and Writing Test Scheduling

Dear Oxford ELLT Team,

I hope this email finds you well. I am writing to request your assistance regarding an issue with my OELLT Listening and Writing tests. Although I have completed the Reading, Listening, and Writing components, the Listening and Writing sections now appear locked on my dashboard—possibly due to an internet or technical issue. I would appreciate your help in unlocking these sections and scheduling a Listening and Writing test slot at your earliest convenience.

Additionally, I have already booked my Speaking test for Wednesday, July 2nd, 2025, at 13:00 (GMT +5:45) / 07:15 UTC. I am unsure whether I will be able to take the Speaking test if the Listening and Writing sections remain locked. If I am able to complete the locked tests, I will be able to finish my OELLT within the limited time available.

Thank you for your support and guidance.
