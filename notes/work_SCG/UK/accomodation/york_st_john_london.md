Weekly rents range from about **£309/week** (Accessible Studio) up to **£589/week** (Premium Terrace Studio) – roughly **£1,300–£2,550/month**. For example, a Standard Studio (\~18m²) costs about **£389–£399/week**, a Classic Studio \~**£399–£439/week**, while larger Premium studios run \~**£479–£589/week**.

There are **communal study and social spaces** throughout the building (modern lounges, a social hub), designed to help with academics and relaxation. In short, Flora Building provides “a modern, well-connected, and vibrant living experience” with all-inclusive utilities and plenty of student-focused facilities.

**Nearby facilities:** The building sits in Hoxton (E2), a lively East London neighborhood. Within a few minutes’ walk are shops and eateries: a **Tesco Express**, **Amazon Fresh** and **Sainsbury’s Local** are all nearby. Sunday’s *Columbia Road Flower Market* is only \~7 minutes away by foot.  Local cafes/restaurants (e.g. Pineapple Xpress, Viet Grill, Sông Quê Café) are within a 5–10 minute walk. Public transport is excellent: **Hoxton Overground station** (Zone 1, HG) is only \~5 min walk, and **Old Street Tube** (Northern line) is \~13 min on foot. Several bus routes serve the area: for instance, routes 26 and 55 (and their night versions) stop at the Hoxton Station bus stop, providing east–west and central-London connections. In summary, residents have easy access to grocery shops, transport links, and Hoxton’s markets/cafés within walking distance.

**Transportation to York St John University (London campus, East India E14 2BA):** York St John’s London campus is in the *Export Building* on East India Dock Road (DLR station “East India”). The fastest public transit route is **Overground + DLR via Shadwell**: walk to Hoxton station (3–5 min), take Overground to Shadwell, then change to the DLR (Beckton branch) to East India. In total this is roughly **15 minutes** travel and costs about **£2–6** with an Oyster card. (In fact, the DLR leg from Shadwell to East India is about 8 min and £1–£3.) By **car/taxi** the 4.6-mile journey takes \~13 min under good traffic; a taxi would cost on the order of **£27–£32**. Other public options include a direct bus (Route D3 runs from Weavers Fields to East India) in roughly **40–50 min** for £1.29, or taking the tube: e.g. Northern line from Old Street to Bank, then DLR from Tower Gateway to East India (DLR times \~12 min). In summary, Overground+DLR via Shadwell is typically quickest; by car/taxi is about 13 min (but more expensive); buses are cheaper but much slower.

**Sample interview Q\&A (choosing this accommodation):**

* **Q:** *Why did you choose to live at Flora Building Hoxton?*
  
  **A:** I chose Flora Building because it is well-located and student-friendly. It’s only a 5-minute walk to Hoxton station, making travel around London and to campus very easy. The accommodation offers all-inclusive bills and high-speed Wi-Fi, plus dedicated study rooms and social spaces – great for a productive study environment. It also has a gym, games room and 24/7 security, which feels very safe and convenient for students.

* **Q:** *How do you plan to commute to York St John London campus?*
  
  **A:** My plan is to walk to Hoxton Overground (\~5 min) and take the train to Shadwell, then switch to the DLR to East India. This route takes about 15 minutes total. The DLR from Shadwell to East India is very quick (\~8 min). I considered taking a bus, but the bus (D3) would take \~40–50 minutes. Driving is faster but expensive and subject to traffic, so Overground+DLR is both efficient (fast) and cheap (£2–3).

* **Q:** *How close is this accommodation to the campus and why is that helpful?*
  
  **A:** The London campus at East India Dock is only one DLR stop from Shadwell, which is \~15 minutes from Hoxton. This means I can easily be at campus by 9 am with little hassle. Being close also means I can join campus events or study groups more easily, and still return home quickly in the evenings.

* **Q:** *In what ways does living here support your academic life?*
  
  **A:** Living at Flora Building supports my studies through its quiet, academic-friendly facilities. All flats have fast, included internet, and there are dedicated study rooms and quiet lounges where I can focus on coursework. The inclusive bills reduce financial stress so I can focus on studies. Plus, being in a student community with social spaces (games room, communal areas) helps me network and unwind healthily between study sessions.
