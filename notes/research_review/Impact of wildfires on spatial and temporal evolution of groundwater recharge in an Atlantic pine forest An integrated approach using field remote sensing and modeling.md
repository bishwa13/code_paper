# Impact of wildfires on spatial and temporal evolution of groundwater recharge in an Atlantic pine forest: An integrated approach using field, remote sensing and modeling

## Introduction

Wildfire is one of the high impact hazards, $CO_2$ - driven climate warming, drought, heat waves, land use management and human activities are the factors for increase in number, frequency, intensity, severity and extent of wildfires around the world. Consequences of forest fires are removal of the top soil-protecting vegetation, ash deposition, changes in the physical properties of rocks and soil, and changes in water qualit and quantity. And these changes also modify the hydrological processes such as evaporation, transpiration and interception.

Evapotranspiration (ET): immediate and long-term reduction (it is different for different years)

Infiltration : Changes in land cover and fire severity may increase runoff. - Causes are 1. removal of porous and organic layer, 2. pore compaction and sealing due to raindrop splash and, 3. water repellency effect caused by heating. 


## Hypothesis

$h_0$ = Wildfires impact groundwater recharge by altering vegetation cover and soil properties

## Objective 
- Investigate and evaluate how groundwater recharge in the Vieira de Leiria-Marinha Grande aquifer is affected by wildfires by integrating meteorological, hydrological, hydrogeological and remote sensing data into a [Soil water Balance Model] to calculate and compare groundwater recharge evolution in the burnt and unburnt areas over time

- How it is done?
  > Ground water recharge evolution in the burnt and unburnt areas overr time is calculated and compared across both pre-fire (2001-2017) and post-fire (2017-2023) periods, considering both burnt and unburnt areas.

## Study Area

- Centre of Portugal (Gentle slop plain of about $320km^2$)
