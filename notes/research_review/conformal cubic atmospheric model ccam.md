# [Conformal Cubic Atmospheric Model](https://research.csiro.au/ccam/getting-started/instructions-for-installing-ccam/)

Traditional climate model like a world map on a flat piece of paper—distorted at the poles.
CCAM, on the other hand, is like wrapping that map around a cube and projecting it smoothly onto a sphere—more uniform and accurate for global coverage.
