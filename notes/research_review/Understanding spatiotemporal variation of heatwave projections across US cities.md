# Understanding spatiotemporal variation of heatwave projections across US cities

#paper #Reading


### Introduction
Cities with high population density inscreasing, so the rexord-shattering temperature extrems and the risk of heat waves. 



### Data Used

- Historical and projected climate data
    - Historical to analyze past heatwave treds
    - Global climate model (Projected) to analyze future risk of heatwave.

- NASA Global Daily Downscaled Projections (NASA GDDP-CMIP6) - bias corrected and downscaled daily climate projection at $ 0.25^\degree * 0.25^\degree $ spatial resoulution - Bias-correction spatial disaggregation (BCSD) method is used for downscaling

### Methodology

- Climate model evaluation
- Temporal variation of heatwave index
    - $ \text{Percentage Change} = \frac{ \text{(future - baseline)} } {baseline} * 100 $

### Strength

- Discuss what the paper did well.

### Weaknesses

- Identify any flaws or areas for improvement.

### Conclusion

- Summarize your review, suggesting the paper's relevance to the field.
