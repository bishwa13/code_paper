# Understanding spatiotemporal variation of heatwave projections across US cities


### Understanding spatiotemporal variation of heatwave projections across US cities

### Introduction
Cities with high population density inscreasing, so the rexord-shattering temperature extrems and the risk of heat waves. 



### Data Used


### Methodology

- Climate model evaluation
- Temporal variation of heatwave index
    - $ \text{Percentage Change} = \frac{ \text{(future - baseline)} } {baseline} * 100 $

### Strength

- Discuss what the paper did well.

### Weaknesses

- Identify any flaws or areas for improvement.

### Conclusion

- Summarize your review, suggesting the paper's relevance to the field.
