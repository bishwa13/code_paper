[Paper link](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijdrr.2025.105539)



Climate change is impacting the popu;ation worldwide, however the urban centers are growing and so does the population density increasing the exposure to weather extremes, which intensifies the challenges faced by economically challeged person/family. Additionally poorer families settled in urban informal settlements floodprone lowlands or landslide-prone slopes and these areas are usually prone to first wave of natural hazards, with lack of infrastructure such as transport roads and drainage systems. Such settlements is usually severely impacted by extreme weather event restricting mobility, destroying assets and exaxerbate economic insecurity. 

- Hazards
    - Drought
    - Extreme Rainfall- flooding and landslides

- Issues
    - Infrastructure damages
    - Increased diseases
    - Transportation disruptions
    - Water and electricity shortages

- Effects
    - Loss of workdays and employment opportunities
    - Asset loss
    - Health deterioration
    - Mobility restrictions
    - Business productivity disruptions


## Conceptual Framework


Climate change is increasing the intensity and frequency of several hazards including heat waves, sea-level rise, drought, and extreme rainfall.

Income/poverty is determined by assets, productivity and opportunities. 
- Extreme events lead to asset loss including financial, physical, human and social capital as well as public goods and infrastructure.
- Loss in productivity due to reduced working hours
- Restriction on productive activities available to the households.

Water related hazards are extreme rainfall and lack of rainfall. Extreme rainfall hazards are flood and landslides which disrupts transport, opportunities loss in assets, increase in health risk from contaminated water and waterborne diseases such as typhoid, dengue, cholera and various infections. Lack of rainfall can cause electricity shortages, risk of water contamination and availability. 


$ \frac{(V_{ji}- Z)}{Z}$ 
Where, $V_{ji}$ household per capita income, $Z$ poverty line
Distance from the to the poverty line indicates how far or close households are from the poverty threshhold, with negative value representing household below the poverty line and positive value above it.
