The application procedure may differ based on the institution you are applying to.

Applying to Public Universities in France:

Nepal is one of the countries that uses the platform "Etude en France." Therefore, if you are applying to public universities in France, you should apply through the platform "Etude en France," commonly known as EEF. Most of the public universities are registered on this platform.

Applying to Private Institutions:

Some private institutions are also registered on the platform EEF, so you can apply via EEF for those institutions as well. However, for most private colleges or universities, you can apply directly. Once you receive your acceptance, for the pre-consular visa procedure, you should go through the platform "Etude en France".  Below you will find the link of EEF.
