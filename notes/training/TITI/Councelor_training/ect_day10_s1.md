Namaskar,

I am greatful to the opportunity TITI provided for me, to learn, perform and improve. 

I didn't thought this training and certification is needed for the job we are doing and want to do. However, this opportunity to participate in 10 days trainning program, convince me requirement of such type of training for Educational counceling profession. I still don't see the compulsory nature of this certification. Saying that, I really recommodate this training to those who havve not participated and it is relevant.


I can not see the any improvement, this program has to under go. I want to wish good things to all the participants, trainers and whole of TITI for brighter future.

Namaskar,

I want to express my sincere gratitude to TITI for providing me with this valuable opportunity to learn, grow, and enhance my professional skills. The experience has been truly transformative.

Initially, I was skeptical about the necessity of this training and certification for our profession in educational counseling. However, after participating in this comprehensive 10-day training program, I have gained a new perspective on its significance. The program has effectively demonstrated the importance of structured training in developing professional counseling skills, standardizing our practices, and elevating the quality of educational counseling services we provide.

While I maintain that making this certification mandatory might need further discussion, I wholeheartedly recommend this training to all professionals in our field who haven't yet participated. The knowledge, skills, and insights gained here are invaluable for anyone serious about excelling in educational counseling.

Looking ahead, I believe this program provides a strong foundation, though there's always room for evolution and adaptation to meet the changing needs of our profession. I extend my best wishes to all my fellow participants, our dedicated trainers, and the entire TITI institution. May we all continue to grow and contribute positively to the field of educational counseling.

Thank you for this enriching experience.

Best regards,
