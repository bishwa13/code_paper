Drone technology continues to advance, making drones ideal tools for gathering certain ground data that can pair well with more traditional mapping techniques.


These are some of the popular uses for drones:

Event Mapping: Music festivals, conventions, and other events can benefit from drone surveying. Event coordinators can use drones to map out where stages or booths are located and provide that data to staff members and attendees.
Damage Surveys: Whether it’s a large-scale natural disaster or a calamity affecting a single home, the aftermath of a destructive event can be surveyed by drones to assess the damages. Insurance companies and authorities can use this data to inform their responses while also keeping field personnel out of what could be hazardous situations.
Crop Surveys: How are the crops doing this season? Drones can provide farmers with an aerial view of their fields to monitor the fields. It’s a fast and efficient way to gather visual data they can use to find trouble spots or to simply check in on progress.
Airspace Mapping: Drones can sometimes be used to map out airspace or to help determine the elevation of certain landmarks and natural features.
Village/Small Town Mapping: While the big cities rely on satellites for their geographical data, small towns and villages might be interested in using drones to get a better look at their layouts.
