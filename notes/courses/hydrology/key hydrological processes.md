Definition of WRA: Systematic evaluation of the quantity, quality, and distribution of water resources to support sustainable management.  
Why River Basin Scale?  
Natural hydrological boundary integrating upstream-downstream dynamics.  
Supports integrated water resources management (IWRM).  
Critical for transboundary cooperation, climate adaptation, and disaster risk reduction.
Goals of WRA:  
Quantify water availability and variability.  
Inform allocation for agriculture, industry, domestic use, and ecosystems.  
Assess impacts of climate change and human activities (e.g., damming, deforestation).
Role of Remote Sensing: Provides spatially extensive, frequent data to complement in-situ measurements, especially in ungauged basins.
Engagement:  
Show a map of a well-known river basin (e.g., Amazon, Nile) and ask students to identify key water uses (e.g., irrigation, hydropower).  
Brief discussion: “Why is it challenging to manage water across a large basin?”
Visuals:

2. Key Hydrological Processes: Precipitation (35 minutes)
Objective: Explain precipitation as the primary input to the hydrological cycle and its assessment in WRA.  
Content:  
Definition: Water falling as rain, snow, hail, or sleet, driving the hydrological cycle.  
Role in WRA:  
Primary source of water for surface and groundwater systems.  
Determines water availability for rivers, lakes, and aquifers.  
Influences flood and drought risks.
Characteristics:  
Spatial variability: Varies across a basin (e.g., mountainous vs. lowland areas).  
Temporal variability: Seasonal (e.g., monsoons) and long-term (e.g., climate-driven trends).
Measurement and Monitoring:  
In-situ: Rain gauges, weather stations (limited spatial coverage).  
Remote Sensing: Satellites like TRMM, GPM provide near-real-time, basin-wide precipitation data.  
Example: GPM’s 0.1° resolution maps rainfall intensity for flood forecasting.
Applications in WRA:  
Estimating water balance (inputs vs. outputs).  
Predicting runoff and flood risks.  
Assessing drought severity.
Case Study: Mekong River Basin – How GPM data tracks monsoon rainfall to predict downstream flooding in Cambodia and Vietnam.
Engagement:

3. Key Hydrological Processes: Evapotranspiration (30 minutes)
Objective: Describe evapotranspiration (ET) as a major water loss mechanism and its role in WRA.  
Content:  
Definition: Combined process of evaporation (from soil/water surfaces) and transpiration (from plants).  
Role in WRA:  
Major water loss in the hydrological cycle, reducing available water.  
Critical for agriculture (irrigation planning) and ecosystem health.  
Influences soil moisture and groundwater recharge.
Characteristics:  
Varies by land cover (e.g., higher in forests, lower in deserts).  
Affected by climate (temperature, humidity) and season.
Measurement and Monitoring:  
In-situ: Eddy covariance towers, lysimeters (sparse and costly).  
Remote Sensing: MODIS, Landsat estimate ET using surface temperature and vegetation indices.  
Example: MODIS ET products provide 1 km resolution data for basin-wide analysis.
Applications in WRA:  
Calculating water balance (e.g., precipitation – ET = available water).  
Optimizing irrigation in agricultural basins.  
Assessing drought impacts on vegetation.
Case Study: Murray-Darling Basin (Australia) – MODIS ET data informs water allocation for crops vs. wetlands.
Engagement:  
Display a MODIS ET map and ask: “Which areas lose more water to ET, and why?”  
Discussion: “How might ET change under climate warming?”

4. Key Hydrological Processes: Runoff (30 minutes)
Objective: Explain runoff as the primary driver of surface water flow and its assessment in WRA.  
Content:  
Definition: Water flowing over the surface into rivers, lakes, or reservoirs after precipitation exceeds soil infiltration and storage.  
Role in WRA:  
Determines river flow and surface water availability.  
Links precipitation to downstream water supply and flood risks.  
Affected by land use (e.g., urbanization increases runoff, forests reduce it).
Characteristics:  
Spatial: Varies by topography, soil type, and land cover.  
Temporal: Peaks during storms or snowmelt, varies seasonally.
Measurement and Monitoring:  
In-situ: Stream gauges measure river discharge (limited to gauged rivers).  
Remote Sensing: Indirectly estimated using precipitation (GPM), soil moisture (SMAP), and digital elevation models (SRTM).  
Example: Sentinel-2 maps water extent to track runoff-driven flooding.
Applications in WRA:  
Estimating river discharge for hydropower and water supply.  
Mapping flood-prone areas.  
Modeling runoff changes due to land use (e.g., deforestation).
Case Study: Amazon Basin – Sentinel-2 tracks runoff-driven inundation in floodplains.
Engagement:

5. Key Hydrological Processes: Groundwater (30 minutes)
Objective: Highlight groundwater as a critical but hidden water resource and its assessment in WRA.  
Content:  
Definition: Water stored in underground aquifers, recharged by infiltration from precipitation and surface water.  
Role in WRA:  
Major source of water for drinking, irrigation, and industry, especially in dry regions.  
Buffers surface water shortages during droughts.  
Vulnerable to overextraction and contamination.
Characteristics:  
Slow movement and long residence times compared to surface water.  
Varies by geology (e.g., porous aquifers vs. impermeable bedrock).
Measurement and Monitoring:  
In-situ: Well measurements (limited spatial coverage).
