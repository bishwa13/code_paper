Detailed Lecture Plan
1. Introduction to Remote Sensing (15 minutes)
Objective: Define remote sensing and its relevance to water resources assessment.  
Content:  
Definition: Remote sensing is the acquisition of information about an object or area without physical contact, typically using sensors on satellites, aircraft, or drones.  
Principles: Relies on detecting electromagnetic (EM) radiation reflected or emitted from the Earth’s surface.  
Applications in Hydrology:  
Mapping water bodies (e.g., rivers, lakes) and flood extents.  
Monitoring precipitation, evapotranspiration, soil moisture, and groundwater.  
Assessing watershed characteristics (e.g., land use, topography).
Advantages:  
Large-scale, frequent coverage for river basins, especially ungauged areas.  
Open-access data (e.g., NASA, ESA) reduces costs.
Relevance to Course:  
Foundation for using remote sensing datasets (e.g., Landsat, Sentinel) in QGIS and Python.  
Enables creation of river basin fact-sheets for the final project.
Engagement:  
Show a satellite image (e.g., Sentinel-2 of a river basin) and ask: “What features can you identify (water, vegetation, urban areas)?”  
Brief discussion: “Why is remote sensing critical for studying remote or transboundary river basins?”
Visuals:

2. Electromagnetic Spectrum (35 minutes)
Objective: Explain the electromagnetic spectrum and its role in remote sensing for hydrology.  
Content:  
Definition: The range of all possible wavelengths of EM radiation, from radio waves to gamma rays.  
Key Regions for Remote Sensing:  
Visible (0.4–0.7 µm): Detects reflected sunlight (e.g., water vs. vegetation).  
Near-Infrared (0.7–1.3 µm): Sensitive to vegetation health and water absorption.  
Shortwave Infrared (1.3–3 µm): Useful for soil moisture and burn mapping.  
Thermal Infrared (8–14 µm): Measures surface temperature (e.g., evapotranspiration).  
Microwave (1 mm–1 m): Penetrates clouds, used for precipitation and soil moisture (e.g., radar).
Interaction with Earth’s Surface:  
Different surfaces (water, soil, vegetation) reflect, absorb, or emit EM radiation uniquely.  
Example: Water absorbs infrared, appearing dark in NIR bands, enabling water body detection.
Applications in Hydrology:  
Visible/NIR: Mapping water bodies (e.g., NDWI with Sentinel-2).  
Thermal: Estimating evapotranspiration (e.g., MODIS).  
Microwave: Measuring precipitation (e.g., GPM) and soil moisture (e.g., SMAP).
Case Study: Sentinel-2 uses visible/NIR bands to map water extent in the Mekong Delta, distinguishing flooded areas from vegetation.
Engagement:  
Show an EM spectrum diagram and ask: “Which wavelengths would you use to detect water vs. vegetation?”  
Quick exercise: Match a hydrological variable (e.g., precipitation) to its EM wavelength (e.g., microwave).
Visuals:  
EM spectrum diagram with labeled bands and examples (e.g., Landsat bands).

3. Active vs. Passive Sensors (35 minutes)
Objective: Compare active and passive sensors and their suitability for hydrological applications.  
Content:  
Passive Sensors:  
Detect natural radiation (e.g., sunlight or thermal emissions) reflected or emitted by the Earth.  
Examples: Landsat (optical), MODIS (optical/thermal), Sentinel-2 (optical).  
Advantages: High spectral resolution, cost-effective, widely available.  
Limitations: Dependent on sunlight, affected by clouds, limited nighttime use.  
Hydrological Use: Mapping water bodies (Sentinel-2), evapotranspiration (MODIS).
Active Sensors:  
Emit their own energy (e.g., radar or laser pulses) and measure the reflected signal.  
Examples: Sentinel-1 (SAR), SMAP (microwave), GPM (radar).  
Advantages: Operate day/night, penetrate clouds, sensitive to surface properties (e.g., soil moisture).  
Limitations: Lower spectral resolution, complex data processing.  
Hydrological Use: Flood mapping (Sentinel-1), precipitation (GPM), soil moisture (SMAP).
Comparison:  
Passive: Best for clear-sky conditions and detailed surface mapping.  
Active: Ideal for cloudy regions, dynamic events (e.g., floods), and subsurface insights.
Case Study: Sentinel-1 (active, SAR) maps flood extents in Bangladesh during monsoon, while Sentinel-2 (passive, optical) struggles with cloud cover.
Engagement:  
Show Sentinel-1 (SAR) and Sentinel-2 (optical) images of the same flood event and ask: “Why does one work better here?”  
Discussion: “When would you choose an active sensor over a passive one for hydrology?”
Visuals:  
Diagram comparing active (SAR emitting pulses) vs. passive (sunlight reflection) sensors.

4. Spatial, Temporal, and Spectral Resolution (35 minutes)
Objective: Define resolution types and their implications for water resources assessment.  
Content:  
Spatial Resolution:  
Size of the smallest feature distinguishable (pixel size).  
Examples:  
High (0.5–10 m): Sentinel-2, PlanetScope (small rivers, wetlands).  
Medium (30–250 m): Landsat, MODIS (larger rivers, lakes).  
Low (>1 km): GPM, GRACE (basin-wide precipitation, groundwater).
Hydrological Use: High resolution for mapping small water bodies; low for regional trends.
Temporal Resolution:  
Frequency of data collection (revisit time).  
Examples:  
High (daily): MODIS, GPM (dynamic processes like floods).  
Medium (5–16 days): Sentinel-2, Landsat (seasonal changes).  
Low (monthly): GRACE (long-term groundwater trends).
Hydrological Use: Frequent data for real-time monitoring; less frequent for long-term analysis.
Spectral Resolution:  
Number and range of wavelength bands detected.  
Examples:  
Multispectral (4–12 bands): Landsat, Sentinel-2 (water, vegetation differentiation).  
Hyperspectral (hundreds of bands): PRISMA (detailed material analysis, less common).  
Single-band (e.g., radar): Sentinel-1 (flood mapping).
Hydrological Use: Multispectral for indices like NDWI; radar for cloud-penetrating tasks.
Trade-offs:  
High spatial resolution often means lower temporal resolution (e.g., Sentinel-2 vs. MODIS).  
Multispectral sensors balance detail and data volume.
Case Study: Landsat (30 m, 16-day) maps seasonal water changes in the Nile Basin, while GPM (10 km, daily) tracks rainfall for flood warnings.
Engagement:  
Show images at different resolutions (e.g., Sentinel-2 vs. MODIS) and ask: “Which is better for mapping a small stream vs. a large basin?”  
Quick poll: “What resolution type is most critical for flood monitoring?”
Visuals:  
Diagram comparing resolution types with examples (e.g., pixel sizes, revisit times).  
Zoomed-in images showing high vs. low spatial resolution.
5. Conclusion and Q&A (30 minutes)
Objective: Summarize key concepts, connect to water resources assessment, and address questions.  
Content:  
Summary:  
Remote sensing uses EM radiation to collect data, with wavelengths (visible, infrared, microwave) tailored to hydrological variables.  
Active sensors (e.g., Sentinel-1) penetrate clouds, while passive sensors (e.g., Landsat) offer detailed spectral data.  
Spatial, temporal, and spectral resolutions determine data suitability (e.g., high-resolution Sentinel-2 for water mapping, frequent GPM for precipitation).
Link to Course:
