% Introducing the purpose of the letter
As a freelance environmental consultant, I am writing to express my commitment to participating in the \trainingtitle\ training program, scheduled for July 31–August 1, 2025 (online) and August 25–29, 2025 (in-person, Bangkok, Thailand), organized by the International Centre for Integrated Mountain Development (ICIMOD). I do not have any support for my role in advancing Disaster Risk Reduction (DRR) and Nature-based Solutions (NbS) in Nepal. I hope ICIMOD will consider my application for this training, which is crucial for enhancing my capacity to contribute effectively to DRR initiatives in the Hindu Kush Himalaya (HKH) region.


% Committing to the training and resource use
I think the \trainingtitle\ training will enhance my expertise in designing and implementing NbS projects I hope ICIMOD will fund my participation. I am dedicated to leveraging the training to promote sustainable DRR in Nepal, ensuring equitable outcomes. For further information, please contact me at mabishwapuri@gmail.com.
