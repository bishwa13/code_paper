1. Details Required
Before you begin, ensure you have assembled:

Data Sources & Timeframes

Historical records (1985–2025) of daily/monthly temperature and precipitation from meteorological stations within the Kulekhani watershed.

Hydrological measurements: reservoir water level, inflow/discharge rates, and power‐generation output (MW) from Indra/Sarowar facilities.

Ancillary data: land‐use changes, reservoir management rules, and regional policy shifts.

Analytical Tools & Techniques

Statistical software (e.g., R, Python) for trend‐analysis (Mann–Kendall, Sen’s slope) and time‐series decomposition.

GIS for spatial interpolation and watershed delineation.

Energy‐yield models or empirical formulas to translate discharge into generation estimates.

Climatic Indices & Metrics

Temperature extremes (TXx, TNn), precipitation intensity indices (R10mm, RX5day), drought indicators (SPI, SPEI).

Hydro‐energy metrics: capacity factor, seasonal variability, drought‐year deficits.

2. Methodology – Key Questions to Answer
When drafting your Methodology, aim to address:

Data Collection & Preprocessing

How were meteorological and hydrological data sourced, quality‑checked, and gap‑filled?

Which interpolation methods (e.g., Inverse Distance Weighting, Kriging) were applied to derive watershed‐averaged time series?

Trend Analysis

Which statistical tests (parametric vs. nonparametric) were employed to detect monotonic trends in temperature, precipitation, and water levels?

How were seasonal and long‑term cycles separated (e.g., via STL decomposition or wavelet analysis)?

Impact Assessment on Hydro‐Energy

What empirical or physically based model converts discharge to generation?

How was sensitivity to temperature and precipitation isolated, for instance by correlating anomalies in inflow with changes in generation output?

Uncertainty & Validation

What confidence intervals or bootstrapping techniques were used to quantify uncertainty in trend estimates?

Which independent datasets (e.g., satellite records or nearby gauging stations) validated your hydrological reconstructions?

3. Results – Key Questions to Answer
Frame your Results so each subsection responds to a precise question:

Climatic Trends

What are the magnitudes and directions of trends in mean temperature and precipitation over the past 40 years?

Have extreme events (e.g., heatwaves, heavy‐rain days) become more frequent or intense?

Hydrological Responses

How has average reservoir inflow and water level shifted seasonally and annually?

Are there identifiable lag times between peak precipitation and peak discharge?

Hydro‐Energy Yield

How has annual generation (in GWh) varied in relation to hydrological changes?

Which months or seasons contribute most to any observed declines or increases in power output?

Statistical Significance

Which trends are statistically significant at the 95 % confidence level, and which remain inconclusive?

4. Discussion & Comparison – Key Questions to Answer
In Discussion, interpret your findings and juxtapose them with the literature:

Interpretation of Trends

To what extent do rising temperatures and altered precipitation regimes explain the observed inflow and generation variability?

Could reservoir management strategies have mitigated or exacerbated these effects?

Comparison with Other Studies

How do your temperature and precipitation trends align with regional assessments in the Himalaya (e.g., Shrestha et al., 2012; Maskey et al., 2020)?

Do changes in hydro‐energy yield mirror those reported in comparable basins (e.g., Nepal’s Marsyangdi or India’s Bhakra)?

Implications & Recommendations

Based on your results, which adaptation measures (e.g., revised reservoir rule curves, demand‑side management) could optimize generation under future climates?

What further research—such as high‑resolution climate modeling or socioeconomic impact studies—would strengthen these conclusions?
