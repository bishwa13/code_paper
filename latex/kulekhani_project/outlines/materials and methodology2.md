One of the objectives  of this study was to estimate the impact of climate change on the future hydropower generation of KHP-I under climate change scenarios, In this study RCP 4.5 scenario is used.
Reservoir and hydropower data necessary for the study, reservoir operation and hydropower generation data from 1982 to 2022, were acquired from the Nepal Electricity Authority(NEA), Nepal. These data were used for the projection of the hydropower generation. 


Canadian Earth System Model 2 (CanESM2) with Baseline Temperature and Precipitation data is used for Bias correction, Linear scaling method and Future Projected climate. 

For Hydrological modeling - DEM data, Land cover Map and soil data is used for Future projected discharge.

For Future energy production linear regression model with future projected discharge is used. 


The river basin information required as an input for HEC-RAS model is such as Digital Elevation model (DEM) of 30m is aquired from  USGS landsat 8. Likewise , land use map of 300 m resolution for 2019 was obtained from the ICIMOD data. and soil data is obtained from The Soil and Terrain database for Nepal, primary data (version 1.0), at scale 1:1 million (SOTER_Nepal). SOTER_Nepal is generalized from the original Soils and Terrain database of Nepal at scale 1:50,000 compiled by FAO and Nepal's Survey Dept. The SOTER_Nepal database provides generalized information on landform and soil properties at a scale 1:1 million. It consists of 17 SOTER units



Historical Data Processing: Daily temperature data were used to calculate daily averages from maximum and minimum values, which were then aggregated to monthly and annual averages for trend analysis. Daily precipitation data were summed to monthly and annual totals to assess trends in water availability.

Downscaled Data: The Statistical DownScaling Model (SDSM)  was employed to generate high-resolution climate data. Historical data (1961–2005) were reconstructed using NCEP-NCAR reanalysis predictors, calibrated with observed Kulekhani station data (1998–2022). Future projections (2006–2100) were generated using the Canadian Earth System Model 2 (CanESM2) under the Representative Concentration Pathway 4.5 (RCP4.5) scenario. Downscaled data were processed to monthly and annual scales for consistency with historical data. 

Hydrological Data: The observed precipitation and temperature data for the baseline period and downscaled GCM data for baseline and future periods were used as the input for the hydrological model HEC-HMS ver. 3.5 in order to estimate river discharge. The simulated river discharge time series were then used for other analysis.
