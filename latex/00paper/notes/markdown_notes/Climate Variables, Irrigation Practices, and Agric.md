# Climate Variables, Irrigation Practices, and Agricultural Productivity in Banke District, Nepal: A Comprehensive Analysis

The findings reveal complex relationships between climate variables, irrigation practices, and agricultural productivity in Banke district. Sunshine hours emerge as the most significant climate factor influencing crop yield, while irrigation availability demonstrates substantial impact on production levels. Despite farmers' general awareness of climate change, specific knowledge gaps exist regarding local temperature effects and adaptation strategies. The study highlights both challenges and opportunities for enhancing agricultural resilience in the face of changing climate conditions.

## Influence of Climate Variables on Crop Productivity

### Sunshine, Temperature, and Rainfall Dynamics

The analysis of climate variables reveals that sunshine hours have the most significant impact on crop productivity in Banke district. The strong positive correlation (r = 0.417, p = 0.017) between sunshine hours and yield, coupled with a significant regression coefficient (β = 0.391, p = 0.029), demonstrates that solar radiation is a critical determinant of agricultural output[^1]. This finding aligns with fundamental plant physiology principles, as adequate sunshine facilitates photosynthesis, enhances metabolic processes, and promotes biomass accumulation. The consistent increase in sunshine hours observed from 1990 to 2020, with a positive slope of 15.15 hours/year, suggests potential benefits for crop production if other environmental factors remain favorable[^1]. The R-squared value of 0.3125 indicates that this upward trend accounts for approximately 31.25% of the variability in sunshine hours, representing a substantial climate shift that warrants attention in agricultural planning.

Temperature exhibited a moderate positive correlation with crop yield (r = 0.287, p = 0.112), although this relationship did not reach statistical significance[^1]. The minor positive temperature trend of 0.0946°C per year observed from 1990 to 2020 reflects the gradual warming consistent with global climate change patterns[^1]. While this warming trend might initially appear beneficial for crop development in Banke's agricultural context, its long-term implications require careful consideration. The non-significant regression coefficient (β = 0.232, p = 0.184) suggests that temperature effects on yield are complex and potentially moderated by other environmental factors[^1]. This complexity likely stems from temperature's multifaceted influence on plant physiology, including its role in determining growing season length, evapotranspiration rates, and thermal stress thresholds. The literature indicates that temperature increases may accelerate crop maturation while simultaneously increasing water demands through enhanced evapotranspiration, creating counterbalancing effects on overall productivity[^1].

Contrary to conventional agricultural wisdom, accumulated rainfall demonstrated a weak negative correlation with yield (r = -0.074, p = 0.686) and a non-significant negative regression coefficient (β = -0.168, p = 0.326)[^1]. This counterintuitive finding may reflect the complex precipitation patterns in Banke district, where timing and distribution of rainfall often prove more critical than total accumulation. The slight positive trend in accumulated rainfall (1.9433 mm/year) observed from 1990 to 2020 might not translate to improved growing conditions if precipitation events become more erratic or intense[^1]. Excessive rainfall during critical growth stages can damage crops, leach nutrients from soil, and create favorable conditions for pest and disease proliferation. This finding underscores the importance of considering rainfall distribution and intensity rather than merely annual totals when assessing climate impacts on agriculture.

### Comparative Analysis with Previous Research

The present study both complements and diverges from previous research conducted in Nepal's agricultural landscapes. The finding that sunshine hours significantly influence crop productivity aligns with Karki et al. (2021), who reported similar sunshine effects on wheat production in Nepal's Terai region[^1]. This consistency across studies strengthens the evidence base regarding solar radiation's importance for agricultural systems in the region and suggests that sunshine optimization should be a key consideration in crop management strategies.

However, our findings diverge from Devkota \& Paija (2020), who found that a 1% increase in rainfall improved rice yield by 0.45%[^1]. In contrast, our study indicates a negative, albeit weak, relationship between rainfall and yield. This discrepancy likely stems from differences in soil properties, irrigation infrastructure, crop types, and local climate patterns across Nepal's diverse agricultural zones. The contrasting results highlight the danger of overgeneralizing climate-yield relationships and underscore the need for location-specific agricultural adaptations.

Our moderate but non-significant correlation between temperature and yield partially aligns with Risal et al. (2022), who noted temperature effects on productivity[^1]. However, while Risal et al. observed negative impacts when temperatures exceeded optimal thresholds, our study did not detect strong negative effects. This difference may reflect varied crop thermal tolerances across regions, adaptations in planting practices, or differences in the range of temperature extremes experienced in the respective study areas.

## Climate Change Perceptions and Agricultural Practices

### Farmers' Climate Awareness and Knowledge Gaps

The investigation into farmers' climate change perceptions reveals a striking paradox: while all farmers in the study area acknowledge general climate change (index value of 1), there exists a profound knowledge gap regarding specific climate parameters and their agricultural implications[^1]. Particularly concerning is the near-complete lack of awareness about local temperature ranges and their effects on agricultural productivity (index value of -0.88)[^1]. This disconnect between general climate awareness and specific climate knowledge represents a significant barrier to effective adaptation planning. Farmers who cannot connect changing temperature patterns to agricultural outcomes face substantial challenges in implementing timely and appropriate adaptation measures.

Similarly troubling is farmers' low awareness regarding untimely monsoons and their production impacts (index value of -0.75)[^1]. Given that 93.3% of agricultural land in the study area relies on rainfed irrigation during the monsoon season, this knowledge gap leaves farmers particularly vulnerable to precipitation variability[^1]. The slightly higher awareness regarding pest and insect effects (index value of 0.28), crop abnormalities due to climate change (index value of 0.275), and extreme weather events (index value of 0.155) suggests that farmers are more attuned to visible and immediate climate impacts than to gradual shifts in temperature or precipitation patterns[^1]. This pattern of awareness likely stems from the tangible and observable nature of pest outbreaks and extreme weather events compared to the subtle, progressive nature of temperature changes.

The discrepancy between general climate awareness and specific climate knowledge highlights the need for targeted agricultural extension services that translate broad climate concepts into locally relevant agricultural information. Educational initiatives should focus on connecting observable changes in weather patterns to their underlying climate drivers and potential agricultural consequences. Participatory monitoring programs could help farmers develop skills in recognizing and responding to climate shifts as they manifest in local contexts.

### Agricultural Adaptation and Food Security

The investigation into agricultural practices reveals limited implementation of diversification strategies, with 97.8% of households not practicing mixed farming or crop combination approaches[^1]. This widespread reliance on conventional monocropping represents a missed opportunity for enhancing climate resilience, as diverse farming systems typically demonstrate greater stability under variable climate conditions. The absence of diversification strategies may reflect knowledge gaps, resource constraints, market preferences, or cultural farming traditions that favor specialized production systems.

Despite limited crop diversification and the predominance of rainfed agriculture, the study area demonstrates remarkable food security, with 92.5% of families producing sufficient food and 97.8% maintaining adequate food stocks[^1]. This apparent resilience likely stems from relatively favorable growing conditions, fertile soils, and farming practices that have evolved to accommodate local environmental constraints. However, the high dependency on self-production (95.5% of food from own production) coupled with minimal institutional support (only 4.5%) suggests potential vulnerability should climate conditions deteriorate beyond farmers' current adaptive capacity[^1].

The observed shift in sowing and harvesting times over the past five years, attributed primarily to irregular monsoons and climate changes, demonstrates farmers' autonomous adaptation to changing conditions[^1]. This calendar adjustment represents a relatively low-cost adaptation strategy that can help align growing periods with evolving precipitation and temperature patterns. However, such temporal adjustments alone may prove insufficient as climate change intensifies, particularly given the limited implementation of other adaptation strategies such as crop diversification or irrigation expansion.

## Irrigation Infrastructure and Agricultural Productivity

### Differential Yields Under Varying Irrigation Regimes

The analysis of irrigation impacts provides compelling evidence of irrigation's critical role in agricultural productivity within the study area. The significant difference in mean yields between year-round irrigation (7868.63 kg/ha) and rainfed systems (5450.43 kg/ha) demonstrates a substantial productivity gap of approximately 44.4% (t(132) = 2.696, p = 0.008)[^1]. This pronounced yield difference underscores irrigation's potential as a climate adaptation strategy that can buffer crops against rainfall variability and enhance overall agricultural resilience.

The stark contrast between irrigation availability and agricultural land coverage represents a significant challenge and opportunity. While only 26.9% of land currently has year-round irrigation access, the documented yield benefits suggest substantial productivity gains could be achieved through irrigation expansion[^1]. The predominance of gravity-fed surface irrigation systems (covering the entire study area) indicates existing water resource utilization knowledge, but potential exists for technological enhancements that could improve water use efficiency and expand coverage[^1].

The heavy reliance on rainfed irrigation during the monsoon season (93.3% of land) creates inherent vulnerability to precipitation variability[^1]. Given the observed shift in cropping calendars attributed to irregular monsoons, expanding year-round irrigation access could provide farmers with greater flexibility in planting decisions and reduce dependence on increasingly unpredictable seasonal rainfall patterns. The positive effect of irrigation on yield likely stems from multiple mechanisms, including reduced water stress during critical growth stages, enhanced nutrient uptake facilitation, and improved growing condition stability.

### Irrigation Expansion Potential and Challenges

The substantial yield gap between irrigated and rainfed systems highlights significant untapped agricultural potential in the study area. If year-round irrigation could be extended beyond the current 26.9% coverage, regional agricultural productivity could increase dramatically[^1]. However, irrigation expansion faces numerous challenges, including infrastructure costs, water source availability, technical expertise requirements, and potential environmental impacts. The reported absence of significant irrigation issues in the study area suggests favorable conditions for system expansion, though this requires verification through detailed hydrological and economic feasibility studies[^1].

The exclusive use of gravity-fed surface irrigation methods (both flood and furrow techniques) indicates potential for technological diversification[^1]. While gravity systems offer cost and operational advantages, they may not maximize water use efficiency compared to modern alternatives such as drip or sprinkler systems. As climate change potentially increases water scarcity through altered precipitation patterns and enhanced evapotranspiration, irrigation efficiency improvements may become increasingly important for sustainable water resource management.

## Implications for Agricultural Policy and Practice

### Climate-Resilient Agricultural Strategies

The findings from this study suggest several priority areas for enhancing agricultural resilience in Banke district. First, the significant impact of sunshine hours on crop productivity indicates that solar radiation optimization should be a key consideration in crop selection and management decisions[^1]. Farmers could benefit from cultivars specifically bred to maximize photosynthetic efficiency under high-radiation conditions, coupled with planting arrangements that minimize self-shading. Agricultural extension services should incorporate solar resource management into farmer training programs, highlighting practices that capitalize on the region's increasing sunshine hours.

Second, the weak but negative relationship between rainfall and yield, coupled with farmers' low awareness of monsoon timing effects, suggests the need for enhanced precipitation management strategies[^1]. Water harvesting systems, field-level moisture conservation techniques, and improved drainage infrastructure could help mitigate both excess and deficit rainfall conditions. Given the observed shift in cropping calendars attributed to irregular monsoons, weather forecasting services tailored to agricultural decision-making could help farmers optimize planting and harvesting timing.

Third, the demonstrated benefits of year-round irrigation on crop yields point to irrigation expansion as a high-priority adaptation strategy[^1]. Policy initiatives should aim to increase irrigation coverage beyond the current 26.9% of agricultural land, with particular emphasis on water-efficient technologies appropriate for local conditions. Hybrid approaches that combine expanded irrigation infrastructure with improved rainfed farming techniques could provide a pragmatic pathway toward enhanced climate resilience.

Fourth, the limited implementation of diversified farming systems presents an opportunity for risk mitigation through crop portfolio diversification[^1]. Mixed farming and crop combination approaches could provide insurance against climate variability by spreading risk across multiple crop types with different climatic vulnerabilities. Agricultural policies should incentivize farm diversification through targeted subsidies, market development for alternative crops, and demonstration projects that showcase diversification benefits.

### Knowledge Enhancement and Institutional Support

The documented gaps in farmers' specific climate knowledge highlight the need for targeted educational initiatives[^1]. Climate information services should focus on translating abstract climate concepts into actionable agricultural insights, emphasizing connections between changing climate parameters and their farm-level implications. Farmer field schools, demonstration plots, and peer-learning networks could facilitate knowledge exchange regarding effective adaptation strategies.

The minimal institutional support reported in the study area (4.5%) suggests considerable scope for expanding agricultural extension services[^1]. Given the complex interactions between climate variables and crop productivity revealed in this study, extension programs should adopt integrated approaches that address multiple dimensions of climate resilience simultaneously. Institutional support mechanisms should move beyond traditional production-focused assistance to incorporate climate risk management, adaptive capacity building, and sustainable intensification approaches.

## Limitations and Future Research Directions

### Methodological Constraints

While this study provides valuable insights into climate-agriculture relationships in Banke district, several methodological limitations warrant consideration. First, the relatively low R-squared value (0.242) in the regression model indicates that a substantial portion of yield variability remains unexplained by the considered climate variables[^1]. This suggests that additional factors—such as soil characteristics, management practices, pest and disease pressure, and genetic crop traits—likely play important roles in determining agricultural productivity. Future research should incorporate these additional variables to develop more comprehensive yield prediction models.

Second, the study's reliance on linear correlation and regression analyses may not fully capture non-linear or threshold-based relationships between climate variables and crop yields. Climate impacts often manifest through complex pathways with threshold effects, interactive influences, and lagged responses that simple linear models cannot adequately represent. Advanced statistical techniques, including non-linear regression, generalized additive models, or machine learning approaches, could provide more nuanced insights into climate-yield relationships.

Third, while the study examines yield differences between irrigation regimes, it does not fully explore the potential interaction effects between irrigation availability and climate variables. Irrigation may moderate climate impacts differently across varying temperature and sunshine conditions, creating complex outcome patterns that deserve detailed investigation. Future studies should explicitly model these interaction effects to better understand how irrigation might buffer climate variability impacts.

### Future Research Priorities

Several promising research directions emerge from this study's findings and limitations. First, longitudinal studies tracking climate-yield relationships over extended time periods would provide deeper insights into adaptation processes and long-term agricultural resilience. Such temporal analyses could help distinguish between short-term weather fluctuations and persistent climate trends, clarifying their respective agricultural impacts.

Second, comparative analyses across different agro-ecological zones within Nepal would help determine the geographic transferability of the observed climate-yield relationships. Such spatial comparisons could identify region-specific vulnerabilities and adaptation opportunities, informing location-tailored agricultural policies. The contrasting findings between this study and previous research highlight the importance of context-specific climate-agriculture assessments.

Third, interdisciplinary research integrating biophysical modeling with socioeconomic analysis would provide a more comprehensive understanding of climate adaptation barriers and enablers. The documented disconnect between general climate awareness and specific climate knowledge suggests complex social and cognitive factors influencing adaptation behaviors that warrant dedicated investigation. Understanding these human dimensions is essential for designing effective climate communication and adaptation support programs.

Fourth, detailed examination of extreme weather events rather than just average climate conditions would enhance understanding of agricultural system vulnerabilities. While this study focused primarily on trends in mean climate variables, extreme events often drive the most significant agricultural impacts and present distinct adaptation challenges. Future research should incorporate extreme event frequency, intensity, and timing into agricultural impact assessments.

## Conclusion

This study reveals the complex interplay between climate variables, irrigation practices, and agricultural productivity in Banke district, Nepal. Sunshine hours emerge as the most significant climate factor influencing crop yields, while year-round irrigation demonstrates substantial potential for enhancing agricultural productivity and climate resilience. Despite widespread general awareness of climate change, specific knowledge gaps regarding local temperature effects and adaptation strategies may constrain farmers' adaptive capacity. The limited implementation of diversification practices, coupled with the predominance of rainfed agriculture, creates potential vulnerabilities as climate variability increases.

These findings highlight several priority areas for agricultural enhancement, including solar radiation optimization, improved precipitation management, irrigation expansion, and farming system diversification. Future research should address the methodological limitations of this study by incorporating additional variables, exploring non-linear relationships, and examining interaction effects between climate factors and management practices. Such expanded analyses would provide more comprehensive insights into climate resilience pathways for Nepalese agriculture.
