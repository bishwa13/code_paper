Subject: Request for Guidance on Publishing Research Paper  
Dear Devkota Sir,  
I hope this email finds you well. My name is Rasila Gautam, and I am a graduate student of College of Applied Sciences-Nepal, currently working on a research paper titled "Assessing the Impact of Climate Variability on Agricultural Productivity and Food Security in Banke, Nepal: Insights from 1990–2020". The study examines the effects of climate variability on crop yields and food security in Nepal’s Banke district over the period 1990–2020, integrating climatic data analysis with insights into farmers’ adaptive practices.  
Given your expertise in the field, I would greatly value your guidance in preparing this paper for publication. Specifically, I would appreciate it if you could review the draft, provide comments on its content and structure, and recommend suitable national or international journals where it might be a good fit for submission. I have attached the current draft, including the abstract and key findings, for your consideration.  
I understand you have a busy schedule, and I would be grateful for any time you could spare to assist me. Please let me know if there’s a convenient time for us to discuss this further or if you require additional details about the study. I am happy to incorporate your feedback and acknowledge your contribution as appropriate.  
Thank you very much for your time and consideration. I look forward to hearing from you.  
Best regards,
