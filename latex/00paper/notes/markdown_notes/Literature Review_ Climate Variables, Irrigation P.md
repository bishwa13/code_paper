# Literature Review: Climate Variables, Irrigation Practices, and Agricultural Productivity in Nepal

## Climate Change and Agricultural Productivity in Nepal

Climate change presents significant challenges to agricultural systems worldwide, with developing countries like Nepal experiencing particularly acute vulnerabilities due to their geographical characteristics and limited adaptive capacity. Nepal's agricultural sector, which contributes approximately 27% to the national GDP and employs over 60% of the population, faces substantial risks from changing climate patterns. This literature review examines current research concerning the relationships between climate variables, irrigation practices, and agricultural productivity in Nepal, with particular emphasis on the context relevant to Banke district.

### Temperature Trends and Agricultural Impacts

Studies examining long-term temperature trends in Nepal have documented consistent warming patterns across various physiographic regions. The warming trend observed in Banke district, with a mean annual increase of 0.0946Â°C between 1990 and 2020, aligns with broader regional climatic shifts documented throughout the Himalayan region. Shrestha et al. (2022) examined the complex relationship between temperature fluctuations and crop physiological processes, noting that temperature increases accelerate crop maturation while simultaneously increasing evapotranspiration rates, thereby creating counterbalancing effects on overall productivity. This phenomenon helps explain the observed moderate positive but non-significant correlation between temperature and yield (r = 0.287, p = 0.112) found in the current study's data.

Research by Risal et al. (2022) further elaborated that temperature impacts on agricultural productivity exhibit threshold effects, where increases beyond certain crop-specific optimal ranges negatively affect yields. Their findings suggested that warming trends initially benefit crop development in cooler regions of Nepal but may eventually lead to detrimental effects as temperatures exceed physiological thresholds. The spatially heterogeneous responses to temperature changes across Nepal's diverse agroecological zones underscore the importance of location-specific analyses when assessing climate change impacts on agriculture.

### Solar Radiation and Crop Productivity

The literature consistently identifies solar radiation as a critical determinant of agricultural productivity in Nepal and broader South Asia. Thapa and Devkota (2016) demonstrated that variations in sunshine hours significantly influenced photosynthetic rates and biomass accumulation across major cereal crops in Nepal's Terai region. Their findings align with the current study's strong positive correlation between sunshine hours and yield (r = 0.417, p = 0.017), confirming the fundamental importance of solar radiation in driving agricultural productivity.

Karki et al. (2021) specifically examined sunshine effects on wheat production in Nepal's Terai region, concluding that adequate solar radiation during critical growth phases substantially enhanced grain filling and overall yields. Their research emphasized that understanding sunshine hour patterns enabled more effective crop selection and management decisions. The documented increase in sunshine hours in Banke district (15.15 hours/year from 1990-2020) suggests potential opportunities for optimizing agricultural practices to capitalize on enhanced solar radiation, provided other growing conditions remain favorable.

### Precipitation Patterns and Agricultural Implications

Research on rainfall effects on agricultural productivity in Nepal presents somewhat contradictory findings, reflecting the complex nature of precipitation-yield relationships. Devkota and Paija (2020) reported that a 1% increase in rainfall improved rice yield by 0.45% in their study area, highlighting the positive association between adequate moisture availability and crop development for water-intensive crops like rice. However, their findings contrast with the current study's weak negative correlation between accumulated rainfall and yield (r = -0.074, p = 0.686), suggesting significant regional and crop-specific variations in rainfall responses.

Regmi et al. (2019) provided insights that help reconcile these apparently contradictory findings, demonstrating that rainfall distribution patterns, rather than total accumulation, critically influence soil moisture availability and subsequent crop performance. Their research in Nepal's mid-hills documented that increasingly erratic precipitation reduced effective moisture availability despite stable or increasing annual totals, leading to compromised agricultural productivity. This phenomenon potentially explains the counterintuitive negative rainfall-yield relationship observed in the current study's data from Banke district, where timing and distribution of rainfall likely prove more critical than total accumulation.

## Farmers' Perceptions and Adaptation Strategies

### Climate Change Awareness and Knowledge Gaps

Research on farmers' climate change perceptions in Nepal reveals interesting patterns of awareness and knowledge distribution. Manandhar et al. (2011) documented high general awareness of climate change among Nepalese farmers but identified substantial knowledge gaps regarding specific climate parameters and their agricultural implications. Their findings parallel the current study's observation of universal climate change awareness (index value of 1) coupled with minimal understanding of local temperature ranges and their effects on agricultural productivity (index value of -0.88).

Budhathoki and Zander (2020) further elaborated that farmers' climate perceptions significantly influenced their adaptation decisions, with those recognizing specific climate impacts more likely to implement responsive measures. Their research emphasized the importance of translating general climate awareness into actionable knowledge about local climate parameters to facilitate effective adaptation. The low awareness regarding untimely monsoons and their production impacts (index value of -0.75) documented in the current study suggests a critical knowledge gap that potentially constrains adaptive capacity in Banke district.

### Agricultural Adaptations to Climate Variability

The literature identifies diverse adaptation strategies employed by Nepalese farmers in response to climate variability. Khanal et al. (2018) documented crop diversification as a widely implemented risk management strategy in Nepal's Terai region, with mixed cropping systems demonstrating enhanced resilience to climate fluctuations. However, their findings contrast sharply with the current study's observation that 97.8% of households in Banke district do not practice mixed farming or crop combination approaches, suggesting significant regional variations in adaptation practices or barriers to diversification.

Poudel and Shaw (2016) examined changing crop calendars as an adaptation response to altered climate patterns, noting that farmers increasingly adjusted planting and harvesting times to accommodate shifting seasonal characteristics. Their research documented that timing adjustments represented a relatively low-cost adaptation strategy accessible to resource-constrained farmers. This finding aligns with the current study's observation of shifted sowing and harvesting times over the past five years in response to irregular monsoons and climate changes in Banke district.

## Irrigation Systems and Agricultural Productivity

### Irrigation Infrastructure and Yield Relationships

Research consistently demonstrates the substantial productivity benefits of irrigation access in Nepal's agricultural landscapes. Bhattarai et al. (2018) quantified yield differences between irrigated and rainfed farming systems across different regions of Nepal, documenting productivity gaps ranging from 30-50% depending on crop type and local conditions. Their findings align with the current study's observed 44.4% yield difference between year-round irrigation (7868.63 kg/ha) and rainfed systems (5450.43 kg/ha) in Banke district.

Sharma and Dhakal (2016) examined the economic dimensions of irrigation investments in Nepal, concluding that strategic irrigation expansion offered among the highest benefit-cost ratios of available agricultural interventions. However, they noted that financial constraints often limited farmers' ability to develop irrigation infrastructure despite its recognized benefits. The current study's finding that only 26.9% of agricultural land in Banke district has year-round irrigation access, despite its demonstrated yield advantages, suggests that similar barriers may constrain irrigation expansion in the study area.

### Traditional and Modern Irrigation Approaches

The literature documents both traditional and contemporary irrigation approaches in Nepal, with varying implications for water use efficiency and agricultural productivity. Pradhan et al. (2017) studied indigenous gravity-fed irrigation systems in Nepal, noting their cultural embeddedness and sustainability advantages, but also identifying efficiency limitations compared to modern alternatives. Their research provides context for understanding the predominance of gravity-fed surface irrigation observed in the current study's area.

Adhikari et al. (2019) evaluated modern irrigation technologies in Nepal's agricultural landscape, documenting substantial water efficiency gains from drip and sprinkler systems compared to traditional surface methods. However, they identified knowledge, financial, and infrastructural barriers that limited widespread adoption of these technologies. The exclusive reliance on gravity-fed surface irrigation methods reported in the current study suggests potential opportunities for technological diversification to enhance water use efficiency in Banke district.

## Research Gaps and Study Relevance

Despite the growing body of literature examining climate-agriculture relationships in Nepal, several knowledge gaps persist. First, most studies focus on single climate variables rather than their interactive effects, potentially overlooking complex synergistic or antagonistic relationships between temperature, rainfall, and sunshine hours. The current study addresses this gap by simultaneously examining multiple climate variables' effects on agricultural productivity.

Second, research connecting farmers' climate perceptions with objective climate measurements remains limited, creating uncertainty about the alignment between perceived and actual climate changes. The integration of both perception data and meteorological records in the current study contributes valuable insights into this relationship in Banke district.

Third, while numerous studies document irrigation benefits, quantitative analyses of yield differences under varying irrigation regimes within specific Nepalese districts remain sparse. The current study's comparison of yields between year-round irrigation and rainfed systems in Banke district provides locally relevant evidence to inform irrigation development policies.

Finally, most climate-agriculture studies in Nepal focus on major cereal crops (rice, wheat, maize), with limited attention to integrated farming systems incorporating multiple crops and livestock. The current study's examination of overall agricultural productivity rather than single-crop yields offers a more comprehensive assessment of climate and irrigation impacts on farming livelihoods in Banke district.
