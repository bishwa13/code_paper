\subsubsection{Methods of Data Collection}
\paragraph{Primary Data Sources}
A comprehensive household survey and intensive field research were conducted across wards 1, 3, and 4 of Janaki Rural Municipality, encompassing 47 villages. Structured interviews and direct observations were employed to gather data on agricultural practices, irrigation access, food security, and perceptions of climate change. Village sample sizes were determined based on household ratios derived from municipal records, followed by systematic sampling of households within each village to ensure representativeness.
\paragraph{Secondary Data Sources}
Secondary data were sourced from a literature review pertinent to the research objectives. Desk-based research, primarily utilizing online resources, provided the majority of the data. Additional information was obtained from reference books, recently published national newspapers, peer-reviewed international journals, government reports, historical records, and relevant websites.
\subsubsection{Sampling Frame}
The study employed stratified random sampling to select wards 1, 3, and 4 from the six wards of Janaki Rural Municipality, using a lottery method for ward selection. These wards were chosen to represent the municipalityâ€™s diversity, with ward 1 comprising 5 villages and wards 3 and 4 each containing 21 villages, as documented in an internal survey from 2075 B.S. Villages within each ward were sampled proportionally using stratified random sampling to enhance diversity and reduce sampling bias. Households within selected villages were then systematically chosen based on household data provided by the municipality. Field observations complemented the survey by providing additional insights into household conditions and local agricultural practices.
