  abstract = {Climate change is happening due to natural factors and human activities. It expressively alters biodiversity, agricultural production, and food security. Mainly, narrowly adapted and endemic species are under extinction. Accordingly, concerns over species extinction are warranted as it provides food for all life forms and primary health care for more than 60--80\% of humans globally. Nevertheless, the impact of climate change on biodiversity and food security has been recognized, little is explored compared to the magnitude of the problem globally. Therefore, the objectives of this review are to identify, appraise, and synthesize the link between climate change, biodiversity, and food security. Data, climatic models, emission, migration, and extinction scenarios, and outputs from previous publications were used. Due to climate change, distributions of species have shifted to higher elevations at a median rate of 11.0 m and 16.9 km per decade to higher latitudes. Accordingly, extinction rates of 1103 species under migration scenarios, provide 21--23\% with unlimited migration and 38--52\% with no migration. When an environmental variation occurs on a timescale shorter than the life of the plant any response could be in terms of a plastic phenotype. However, phenotypic plasticity could buffer species against the long-term effects of climate change. Furthermore, climate change affects food security particularly in communities and locations that depend on rain-fed agriculture. Crops and plants have thresholds beyond which growth and yield are compromised. Accordingly, agricultural yields in Africa alone could be decline by more than 30\% in 2050. Therefore, solving food shortages through bringing extra land into agriculture and exploiting new fish stocks is a costly solution, when protecting biodiversity is given priority. Therefore, mitigating food waste, compensating food-insecure people conserving biodiversity, effective use of genetic resources, and traditional ecological knowledge could decrease further biodiversity loss, and meet food security under climate change scenarios. However, achieving food security under such scenario requires strong policies, releasing high-yielding stress resistant varieties, developing climate resilient irrigation structures, and agriculture. Therefore, degraded land restoration, land use changes, use of bio-energy, sustainable forest management, and community based biodiversity conservation are recommended to mitigate climate change impacts.},

The changes in both physical and dynamical formulation from CCM2 to CCM3 are presented. The major differences in CCM3 compared to CCM2 include changes to the parameterization of cloud properties, clear sky longwave radiation, deep convection, boundary layer processes, and land surface processes. A brief description of each of these parameterization changes is provided. These modiﬁcations to model physics have led to dramatic improvements in the simulated climate of the CCM. In particular, the top of atmosphere cloud radiative forcing is now in good agreement with observations, the Northern Hemisphere winter dynamical simulation has signiﬁcantly improved, biases in surface land temperatures and precipitation have been substantially reduced, and the implied ocean heat transport is in very good agreement with recent observational estimates. The improvement in implied ocean heat transport is among the more important attributes of the CCM3 since it is used as the atmospheric component of the NCAR Climate System Model. Future improvements to the CCM3 are also discussed.},

	abstract = {This paper reviews the agricultural land use pattern of Nepal based on published information. Agricultural land use in Nepal is closely related with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal Two, which deals with the food security. To meet the increasing food demand, the ecological belts; Terai, and Hills should have a sustainable agricultural production system. However, land fragmentation is high in rapidly urbanizing Terai whereas increasing fallow land and landlord absenteeism is widely prevalent in Hills; both of these scenarios has brought changes in land use pattern for agricultural crops. Under this context, this paper attempts to discuss the changes in major crops grown areas in different time periods and their consequences along with factors responsible for such changes. Multiple factors such as- migration, real-estate business, and an increment in land use for off-farm activities are thought to be responsible for such change in the cropping area. On the other hand, increase in production of major crops has its low level of impact to the progress in food security which is rather related to the swelled purchasing capacity of food through remittance. To address the inefficient land use and low crop production issue, Government of Nepal has endorsed the Land Use Act, 2019 whereas its proper implementation at field level is quite important. Since, poor land management practices have significantly affected soil quality and crop production, urgent steps are needed to reverse the trends in land degradation while maintaining productivity of land through sustainable land management approaches.},

The mountainous area such as Rasuwa District in Nepal is more vulnerable due to complex topography, human activity (tourism), and climate change. In this context, we carried out this study to assess the climate change and its impact on agriculture production as well as people's perceptions on the impact of climate change. The long-term (1980–2014) observed climate data (temperature and precipitation) and ﬁeld-based survey data on people's perceptions were analyzed. Mann-Kendall trend test and Sen's slope estimation were used to analyze the temperature and precipitation trends. Furthermore, key informant interviews (KIIs) and focal group discussions (FGDs) were conducted to understand people's perceptions of the impact of climate change on agricultural production. Further, ERA5 and APHRODITE datasets were used to compare the in situ climate data. The maximum temperature and total precipitation in summer monsoon (June–September) were found increasing signiﬁcantly at rates of 0.07 C/a and 19.89 mm/a, respectively. But the minimum winter temperature and winter precipitation were found decrease by 0.05 C/a and 4.89 mm/a, respectively. Moreover, a large number of respondents reported a decrease in millet and wheat productions while an increase in potato production over the considered time duration (1990–2014). It is noteworthy that the respondents from the mid-elevation regions perceived an increasing trend in crop production compared to those from the low elevation regions. In recent years, people living in the high elevation regions of Rasuwa District have started to shift their cropping calendar to increase agricultural production. This study will provide useful information for policy-makers in formulating adaptation strategies in mountainous areas of Nepal.},

	abstract = {Climate variability and insufficient irrigation are primary constraints to stable and higher agricultural produc­ tivity and food security in Nepal. Agriculture is the largest global freshwater user, and integration of surface- and ground-water use is frequently presented as an strategy for increasing efficiency as well as climate change adaptation. However, conjunctive management (CM) planning often ignores demand-side requirements and a broader set of sustainable development considerations, including ecosystem health and economics of different development strategies. While there is generic understanding of conjunctive use, detailed technical knowhow to realize the CM is lacking in Nepal. This article presents a holistic framework through literature reviews, stake­ holders consultations and expert interviews for assessing CM and implementation prospects from a systems-level perspective. We demonstrate the framework through a case study in Western Nepal, where climatic variability and a lack of irrigation are key impediments to increased agricultural productivity and sustainable development. Results show that knowledge of water resources availability is good and that of water demand low in the Western Terai. Additional and coordinated investments are required to improve knowledge gaps as well as access to irrigation. There is therefore a need to assess water resources availability, water access, use and productivity, to fill the knowledge gaps in order to pave pathways for CM. This paper also discusses some strategies to translate prospects of conjunctive management into implementation.},

	abstract = {This paper provides a comprehensive review of literature related to the assessment of climate change impacts on crop productivity using climate, water and crop yield models. The existing studies present that climate change models with higher spatial resolution can be a way forward for future climate projections. Meanwhile, stochastic projections of more than one climate model are necessary for providing insights into model uncertainties as well as to develop risk management strategies. It is projected that water availability will increase in some parts of the world, which will have its own eﬀect on water use eﬃciency and water allocation. Crop production can increase if irrigated areas are expanded or irrigation is intensiﬁed, but these may increase the rate of environmental degradation. Since climate change impacts on soil water balance will lead to changes of soil evaporation and plant transpiration, consequently, the crop growth period may shorten in the future impacting on water productivity. Crop yields aﬀected by climate change are projected to be diﬀerent in various areas, in some areas crop yields will increase, and for other areas it will decrease depending on the latitude of the area and irrigation application. Existing modelling results show that an increase in precipitation will increase crop yield, and what is more, crop yield is more sensitive to the precipitation than temperature. If water availability is reduced in the future, soils of high water holding capacity will be better to reduce the impact of drought while maintaining crop yield. With the temperature increasing and precipitation ﬂuctuations, water availability and crop production are likely to decrease in the future. If the irrigated areas are expanded, the total crop production will increase; however, food and environmental quality may degrade.},

As a result, low Soil Organic Matter (SOM), reduced crop productivity, increased food safety hazards, and negative impacts on human health and the environment are reported in the agriculture sector in Nepal. In 2018, the concept of Good Agriculture Practices (GAP) was introduced in Nepal to address the issues of food safety, trade, and sustainability. As GAP is relatively new to Nepal, it is still broad and ambiguous, which makes its use and implementation difficult. For this purpose, we conducted a literature review on available global evidence to present the benefits of GAP and to identify the critical barriers to the adoption of GA. The review shows GAP’s potential to increase crop yield by up to 36\%, reduce agrochemicals use by 31\%, increase SOM from a mean of 3.32\%–3.77\%, and increase farmers’ income by more than 100\%. However, the review has also identified barriers to wider adoption of GAP, broadly categorized into production, extension, regulation and standards, and markets and finance. The valuable outcome of this review is that it proposes five key pathways: (i) Technical capacity building, (ii) Awareness creation, (iii) Soil fertility management strategies, (iv) Extension programs, and (v) Market development for institutionalizing GAP in Nepal, based on the learning from global evidence. This review could be useful for policymakers and the government of Nepal to develop detailed implementation guidelines for GAP, including appropriate policies as well as short, medium, and long-term plans and programs for institutionalizing GAP in Nepal.},

The global population is increasing and to meet their demand for fuel, food, and fiber, Farmer should adopt sustainable agriculture practices which provides resilience to climate change and uplifts the farmers' livelihood. Climate-smart agriculture practices are taken as eco-friendly practices that help to enhance production sustainably with minimum effect on resources and environments. These practices include No-tillage, reduced tillage, Intercropping, integrated pest management, Rainwater harvesting, use of information and communication technology, etc. As women are an integral part of agriculture production and are more vulnerable to climate change, the Genderresponsive approach needs to be addressed which helps to close the gender gap in agriculture. Nepal, as a vulnerable country in terms of climate change, is adopting different programs and policies at the national and local level to tackle climate change. Climate-smart villages(CSV) in Nepal are practicing different CSA practices at the farm level to secure foods and livelihoods.},

To gather information, a semistructured questionnaire was used to survey 52 households, and two focus group discussions were conducted. The study found that the major indigenous crops were summer crops that were sowed in the months of Baisakh and Jestha and harvested in Ashoj and Kartik. These crops required less water. On the other hand, winter season crops such as naked barley and wheat (pabai) required more than seven months for harvesting. Beans, buckwheat, potato, and finger millet were the major crops produced in the study area. Beans, buckwheat, and barley were cultivated by a higher number of households, while buckwheat, potato, and beans had high crop production. The majority of farmers practices a two-year crop rotation. Additionally, the study found that socio-economic factors such as gender, farmer’s age, caste, family size, and total crop production had a significant relation on maintaining on-farm crop diversity. The study concluded that local farmers in Humla district continue to rely on traditional practices for crop management, which are well-suited to the local agro-climatic conditions. However, it is necessary to give greater emphasis to increasing cropping intensity through the introduction of new technology and innovation, suitable crop management methods, and the protection of indigenous crops to enhance food security and agricultural sustainability in the region.},

	abstract = {Climate change inﬂuences crop yield vis-à-vis crop production to a greater extent in countries like Nepal where agriculture depends largely on natural circumstances. Plausible scenarios of climate change like higher temperatures and changes in precipitation will directly affect crop yields. Therefore, this study assesses the effect of observed climate variables on yield of major food-crops in Nepal, namely rice, wheat, maize, millet, barley and potato based on regression model for historical (1978-2008) climatic data and yield data for the food-crops. The yield growth rate of all the foodcrops is positive. However, the growth rate for all crops, except potato and wheat, is below population growth rate during the period. Climate variables like temperature and precipitation are the important determinants of crop yields. Trend of precipitation is neither increasing nor decreasing signiﬁcantly during this period. However, temperature is increasing by 0.7 °C during the period. Climate variables show some influences on the yield of these major food-crops in Nepal. Increase in summer rain and maximum temperature has contributed positively to rice yield. Also, increase in summer rain and minimum temperature has positive impact on potato yield. However, increase in summer rain and maximum temperature adversely affected the yield of maize and millet. Increase in wheat and barley yield is contributed by current trend of winter rain and temperature. Consideration of spatial variation in similar type of study in Nepal that will be helpful in identifying the region more vulnerable to climate change in terms of crop yield is highly recommended.},

Lesser availability of surface and sub surface water for irrigation particularly during non monsoon seasons will adversely affect on the winter crop production combined with flood damages to the arable lands in summer. Vulnerability to the infrastructures will affect food supply and access particularly in the mountain region where people are already in the surge of price hikes.

With an average of 0.06oC/yea, a rise in temperature from 1975 to 2006 by 1.8oC has been recorded in the country. Problem of frequent drought, severe floods, landslides and mixed type of effects in agricultural crops have been experienced in Nepal because of climate change. Study done on CO2 enrichment technology at Khumaltar revealed that the yield of rice and wheat increased by 26.6\% and 18.4\% due to double CO2, 17.1\% and 8.6\% due to increase in temperature respectively. A crop simulation model (DSSAT) to study the effects of CO2, temperature and rain in NARC showed positive effect in yield of rice and wheat in all regions, but negative effect in maize especially in Terai. In Nepalese agriculture, the time has come for the authorities to find out adaptive measures to mitigate the effects to reduce untold natural calamities and miseries due to recent erratic weather pattern.},

	abstract = {Studies on rural livelihood and agriculture patterns from different parts of Nepal have mentioned the introduction of new crops from different pocket areas of the country primarily resulted due to climate change and market development. However, these studies have lacked scholarship on how the changes occur in rural areas and how rural households have adopted the changes are least focused. Based on the field surveys using questionnaires, interviews, FGD, analysis of climate data, and map data, this paper aims to fulfill the aforementioned gap based on the study from three elevation zones. It shows a wider adoption of different new crops and vegetables which are varied by elevation zones and by the cultural groups living there. The detailed analysis of various events and underlying processes concludes that out-migration and off-farm employment, infrastructure development and increasing connectivity, climate change, access to market, and changing food habits are the major drivers of the changes. These drivers began to play their roles at different times, and different scales in different zones, and finally their complex interplay resulted changes in the rural agricultural landscape.},

	abstract = {Information on the distribution of soil properties is important to know the status of nutrients in the soils based on which fertilizer nutrients are recommended. Given the variability of nutrients in the soils, making a site-specific fertilizer recommendation seems to be a compelling work. To determine the spatial variability of soil nutrients and to make judicious and precise fertilizer recommendations, new measures are designed with this study. These measures are tested against the soil samples (n = 43) for total nitrogen (N), organic matter (OM), phosphorus (P2O5), and potassium (K2O) in the study area. The descriptive statistical analysis indicated an average of low nitrogen and organic matter, while phosphorus was found to be very high and the level of potassium was high. The spread of nutrients across the data sets, however, included low, medium, high, and very high levels of ratings. The Deviation Square Index was developed and applied for the variability measurement and found that the largest variation was with phosphorus distribution, followed by potassium, nitrogen, and organic matter. The coefficient of variation (CV\%) analysis also exhibited similar trends in nutrient distributions. Nitrogen was the main determinant explaining the variations in rice yield, while phosphorus and potash were negatively related to the yield. An index of fertilizer nutrient recommendation called Test-Value Specific Dose (TVSD) was developed and used to calculate the nutrient recommendation for each sampled location. This new method gave easy and more accurate doses of fertilizer over the blanket recommendation to fit the variations across the soil samples.},

	abstract = {Basically everyone agrees that women and men are different. Women and men in the household are generally subject to the division of labor. This division of labor led to the development of limited social roles for both sexes and the creation of power differences in some respects that were more favorable to men. This role is seen in poor families in Padang Bolak Tenggara District. Thus, research was carried out to find out more about the role of women in supporting the economy of poor households in farming families in the District of Padang Bolak Tenggara, the profile of women (farmer's wives) who worked, the time spent required by farmers' wives, and what gender issues arose due to the involvement of the farmer's wife in supporting the family's economy. This paper is a gender perspective. The essence of gender perspective research is a study that clearly seeks to express women's experiences and gender relations according to a central issue that needs attention. Data collection methods using observation and interviews. In conducting data processing and analysis, researchers use Harvard analysis techniques. This technique is often referred to as Gender Framework Analysis (GFA), which is an analysis used to look at the gender profile of a social group and the role of gender in development. Based on observations in the District of Padang Bolak Tenggara of the farming family, it is known that the farmer's wife is very involved in helping the family economy. The profile of women (farmers' wives) in the District of Padang Bolak Tenggara can be seen from the average age of 40-50 years, 65\% have a junior high school education background, only 3 people who have makeup/salon and sewing skills, besides farming. The intensity of time spent by women (farmer's wives) working outside is quite high at around 8-10 hours per day. This still does not include homework, i.e. doing homework and caring for children. This makes the workload and working time span of farmer's wives much longer than men. Thus, the gender issue that arises is injustice in the division of labor.},

The study thus aims to examine the impact of climate change and variability on crop productivity using crop production data from the Ministry of Agriculture and Livestock Development and climatic data from the Department of Hydrology and Meteorology located in three districts viz. Banke, Dailekh and Mugu districts. Multivariate time series regression analysis is used considering crop yield as dependent variable and precipitation, minimum and maximum average temperature as explanatory variables. The precipitation and average minimum temperature are found positively significant in most of the cases while the effect of average maximum temperature is negative in general. Precipitation seems to have more impact on rain fed agriculture while rising of maximum temperature is found to be positive impact in mountain district mainly for winter crops, while maximum temperature shows a positive impact on crop productivity at national level. Policy needs to be identified adaptation options for crops suitable in the different agro ecological belts as well as enhanced irrigation facilities in general to reduce risk from the climate change.},

The Purposive Random Sampling wasdone where 80 Household (Sample Size) were selected for our survey i.e., 40 among them were involved in Cooperative and 40 were not. A comparative analysis was done to find the differences between cooperative and non- cooperative farmers. There were differences in various socio-economic aspects like Age, Education, ethnicity, training and subsidy, mechanization, among the cooperative and non-cooperative farmers. Significant impact was found on the farming practices, marketing status and socioeconomic condition among two different groups of farmers. Farmers involved in cooperatives were observed to perform comparatively improved farming practices which were due to accessibility of Farm Inputs and subsidy. Thus it could be concluded that there was significant impact of agricultural cooperative in the farming practices making positive changes on the livelihood of the farmers involved in cooperatives.},

The simulation parameters are conducted with five different objective function methods, and evaluations of the model performance are explained in addition to graphical methods with different metrics including NSCE, MRE and PCC. Results show that the HECHMS simulations capture time of the peak although predictions slightly underestimate value of the peak flows and runoff volume. Nevertheless, runoff fluctuation is simulated well respect to observed hydrographs over the watershed during both calibration and verification periods. In addition, the obtained simulation values with this study show that the hydrograph values of the rivers in the Ballikaya Watershed have the potential to be predicted via computer environment without any need from gauging measurements.

	abstract = {Background
              The majority of Nepalese people are involved in farming. However, due to limited knowledge of zoonoses and poor preventive practices on the part of livestock farmers, vulnerabilities to zoonotic diseases are very high. The main objective of this study was to assess the regional variation in zoonoses-related knowledge and preventive practices of livestock farmers in different ecological regions of Nepal.
            
            
              Material and methods
              Descriptive cross-sectional quantitative research design was followed in the study. The total sample size was 380 livestock farmers from randomly selected three ecological regions of Nepal. Systematic sampling techniques were applied for data collection. Data were entered into an excel sheet and then imported into Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) software. The data were calculated using descriptive statistics. Univariate, and bivariate analyses were performed, and the result of the study was presented in the form of text and tables based on their nature.
            
            
              Results
              Of the studied six zoonotic diseases, most of the respondents (95.8\%) knew about zoonotic bird flu; 90.7\% of them, were about rabies; and 54.2\% knew about swine flu. However, a few respondents knew about bovine tuberculosis, neurocysticercosis, and brucellosis. Ecologically, the highest number of respondents in Nawalpur had knowledge of rabies (95.3\%), and swine flu (61.6\%), whereas 98.3\% of them had knowledge of avian influenza in Tanahun; and 12.5\% of neurocysticercosis in Manang. Regarding zoonoses preventive practices such as regular hand washing with soap water, mask-wearing, gloves, boots, the respondents’ representation of 60.8\%, 6.6\%, 1.8\%, and 1.3\% respectively in such practices show that although these are easy and cost-effective, personal protective equipment (PPE), such preventive practices were extremely underperformed. Not only that, only 12\% of respondents maintain a standard distance ({\textgreater}15m.) between their house and shed. Similarly, 17\% still consumed meat from sick animals, and vaccination of livestock was also found poor coverage (36\%) in the study.
            
            
              Conclusions
              Livestock farmers need to be more knowledgeable about many common zoonotic diseases, and their preventive practices still need improvement, with significant regional variation in the study. This has invited various zoonosis threats for them. Therefore, it is recommended that the interventional programs related to common zoonoses be conducted for livestock farmers to solve the problem.},

	abstract = {Climate change has been considered to have catastrophic effects on planet Earth. It has become a major barrier to developing economies, like India where agriculture accounts for 55 per cent of its total working population (Registrar General 2013) and constitutes about 14.1 per cent of its GDP (GoI, 2013). Moreover, due to the alteration in climate, crop productivity is being affected adversely resulting in food and livelihood security issues. This study is based on state level data of 4 major seasonal Indian crops- Rice, Wheat, Cotton, Sugarcane which comprise of Food and Cash crops for the time span of 2004 to 2013. 7 agriculturally intensive states with varied climatic conditions have been taken into consideration for the study. States under tropical zones include West Bengal, Maharashtra, Uttar Pradesh, Gujarat, while the subtropical regions are Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu and Karnataka. This thesis makes an attempt to analyze the impact of climate change on Indian Agriculture and food security. It also examines the implications of climate change on food security and evaluates the multiple benefits of mitigation and adaptation. Cobb Douglas production function will be incorporated in this model to simulate this impact of climate change on agricultural productivity. Majority of the crops taken into consideration are expected to be adversely affected by the future climatic conditions. Local adaptation practices have also been scrutinized, highlighting the role of institutional support, national adaptation strategies and resilience at different scales.},

It identiﬁes promoting development of Nepal’s hydropower potential to provide energy for pumping as way to improve water security in agriculture. Renewable groundwater reserves of 1.4 billion cubic meters (BCM), from an estimated available balance of 6.9 BCM, could be pumped to irrigate 613,000 ha of rainfed agricultural land in the Terai plains, with a potential direct economic gain of USD 1.1 billion annually and associated beneﬁts including promotion of energy-based industry, food security and local employment. Governance also plays an important role in addressing water security. We conclude that a nexus-based approach is required for eﬀective water management and governance.},

Drought particularly affected the traditionally food surplus areas of the Eastern Terai, particularly Siraha, Saptari and Dhanusha which reported a decline in paddy production of about 30\%. A total of 109,855 hectares of paddy land (7.09\%) remained fallow in 2006/07 as farmers were unable to plant due to drought. In addition, yields were lower by almost 6\%. Paddy crop production consequently declined by 12.5 \% compared to last year.

Reduction in the potential of productive lands due to floods, landslides and erosion are also the issues at peak. Every year, flood sweeps a huge amount of productive lands in Terai whereas the lands in hills are fallow due to rain deficit. Various steps are being taken by government to adapt to climate change. Several policies are made. Some of the policies are implemented and some are yet to be implemented.

	abstract = {This paper reviews the agricultural land use pattern of Nepal based on published information. Agricultural land use in Nepal is closely related with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal Two, which deals with the food security. To meet the increasing food demand, the ecological belts; Terai, and Hills should have a sustainable agricultural production system. However, land fragmentation is high in rapidly urbanizing Terai whereas increasing fallow land and landlord absenteeism is widely prevalent in Hills; both of these scenarios has brought changes in land use pattern for agricultural crops. Under this context, this paper attempts to discuss the changes in major crops grown areas in different time periods and their consequences along with factors responsible for such changes. Multiple factors such as- migration, real-estate business, and an increment in land use for off-farm activities are thought to be responsible for such change in the cropping area. On the other hand, increase in production of major crops has its low level of impact to the progress in food security which is rather related to the swelled purchasing capacity of food through remittance. To address the inefficient land use and low crop production issue, Government of Nepal has endorsed the Land Use Act, 2019 whereas its proper implementation at field level is quite important. Since, poor land management practices have significantly affected soil quality and crop production, urgent steps are needed to reverse the trends in land degradation while maintaining productivity of land through sustainable land management approaches.},

	abstract = {West Tennessee’s supplemental irrigation management at a ﬁeld level is profoundly affected by the spatial heterogeneity of soil moisture and the temporal variability of weather. The introduction of precision farming techniques has enabled farmers to collect site-speciﬁc data that provide valuable quantitative information for effective irrigation management. Consequently, a two-year on-farm irrigation experiment in a 73 ha cotton ﬁeld in west Tennessee was conducted and a variety of farming data were collected to understand the relationship between crop yields, the spatial heterogeneity of soil water content, and supplemental irrigation management. The soil water content showed higher correlations with soil textural information including sand (r = −0.9), silt (r = 0.85), and clay (r = 0.83) than with soil bulk density (r = −0.27). Spatial statistical analysis of the collected soil samples (i.e., 400 samples: 100 locations at four depths from 0–1 m) showed that soil texture and soil water content had clustered patterns within different depths, but BD mostly had random patterns. ECa maps tended to follow the same general spatial patterns as those for soil texture and water content. Overall, supplemental irrigation improved the cotton lint yield in comparison to rainfed throughout the two-year irrigation study, while the yield response to supplemental irrigation differed across the soil types. The yield increase due to irrigation was more pronounced for coarse-textured soils, while a yield reduction was observed when higher irrigation water was applied to ﬁne-textured soils. In addition, in-season rainfall patterns had a profound impact on yield and crop response to supplemental irrigation regimes. The spatial analysis of the multiyear yield data revealed a substantial similarity between yield and plant-available water patterns. Consequently, variable rate irrigation guided with farming data seems to be the ideal management strategy to address ﬁeld level spatial variability in plant-available water, as well as temporal variability in in-season rainfall patterns.},

The results revealed that the grain yield (2.38 Mt ha-1) obtained in control without nitrogen was significantly lower in comparison to the other levels (70, 140 and 210 kg N ha-1). Moreover, grain yield (5.45 Mt ha-1) produced by the application of 210 kg N ha-1 was significantly superior over 70 kg N ha-1 (3.83 Mt ha-1) but remained at par with 140 kg N ha-1 (5.02 Mt ha-1). The grain yield (4.98 Mt ha-1) recorded with the population of 101010 plants ha-1 was significantly superior over 55,555 with 3.34 Mt ha-1 and 69,444 with 3.90 Mt ha-1 plants ha-1 but similar to that of 85,470 plants ha-1 with 4.46 Mt ha-1 which was also significantly higher as compared to 69,444 and 55,555 plants ha-1 and were at par with each other. Regression analysis revealed that the ineraction between level of N and plant population were significant and positive correlation was found between higher level of N and plant population. Thus, hybrid maize (RML95/RML96) can be successfully grown by applying 145 kg N ha-1 and maintaining a population of 87 thousand plants ha-1 to achieve a higher grain yield during the winter season.},

	abstract = {The low productivity of lentil due to adaptation of poor crop management practices is the main problem of the lentil production in western terai region of Nepal. With an objective of selecting appropriate variety, sowing time, sowing method, seeding rate, priming techniques and weed management practice for lentil cultivation four different experiments were conducted at Grain Legumes Research Program, Khajura, Banke in two winter seasons of 2017/18 and 2018/19. The experiment on sowing time was conducted in split-plot design including four lentil varieties and four sowing dates, while the seeding rate experiment was laid out in split-split-plot design with the treatments of two varieties, two sowing methods and four seed rates. Similarly, seed priming and weed management trails were conducted in RCBD with ten treatments. All the experiments were replicated three times. The highest seed yield of lentil was recorded from the early maturing lentil varieties, i.e. PL 4 (934 kg ha–1) and ILL 7979 (864 kg ha–1). Similarly, lentil sowing on October (940 kg ha–1) produced the higher seed yield than sowing on November (682 kg ha–1). Likewise, the highest seed yield of lentil was recorded from the use of seeding rate 60 kg ha–1 (890 kg ha–1), but it was statistically at par with the seeding rates of 40 kg ha–1 (865 kg ha–1) and 50 kg ha–1 (855 kg ha–1). Differently, the seed yield of lentil didn‘t differ significantly under line (856 kg ha–1) and broadcasting (847 kg ha–1) methods of sowing. The seed priming with a 250 ppm solution of sodium molybdate (Na2MoO4) produced significantly the highest seed yield (961 kg ha–1) in lentil. Similarly, the highest and statistically similar seed yield of lentil was recorded with the weed management practice of two hand weeding (924 kg ha–1) and the use of Pendimethalin (898 kg ha–1) and Pendimethalin-Quizolofop-ethyl (857 kg ha–1) as a preemergence. Thus, the adaptation of appropriate variety, planting time, seeding rate, seed priming technique, sowing method and weed management practices are the major factors of production for getting higher yield of lentil.},

	abstract = {Modern agriculture is heavily dependent on soil. Soil‘s carrying capacity is being decreased these days due to erosion, depletion of soil nutrients and climate change. Regenerative agriculture is a way of farming both plants and animals that enriches and restores topsoil, and in turn, improves the water cycle. Nepal is also facing the ill effects of the conventional agriculture system. Therefore, an attempt has been made in this review article to highlight some of the alternative production systems suitable for Nepal. The findings of this review paper were about regenerative agriculture technology reduced the cost of production through minimum tillage, less use of agriculture inputs, less labor, consumption of less irrigation, maintaining soil moisture, water holding capacity and nutrient value through crop residue, crop rotation, soil cover, reduced soil erosion and run off top layer soil and increases the soil fertility through soil carbon sequestration that mitigates the climate change effects. The major constraints of regenerative agriculture are the lack of appropriate information and technologies in hand. For policymakers, farmers and food processing and marketing companies, regenerative agriculture has been an alternative production system with lower impacts on the environment. Therefore, to promote the identified and developed regenerative agricultural practices, participatory research in the farmer‘s field with large-scale demonstration across the egro-ecological domains of the country.},

Conservation Agriculture (CA) underlying principles of minimal soil disturbance, soil cover and crop rotation are increasingly recognized as an essential for the sustainability of this cropping system. Therefore, a brief review was done to find out the results its constraints and the possible interventions under a maize-based system of Nepal. Very few works under CA is done so far under maize-based cropping system of Nepal, however, the results are encouraging. There are some constraints in CA technologies promotion, such as scaleneutral agri-machineries, crop residues competition between CA use and livestock feeding, skilled and scientific manpower availability and overcoming the bias or mindset about tillage. CA provide opportunities to reduce the cost of production, improve resource use efficiency, saves water and nutrients and increase yield. There is a need to develop and promote low-cost technologies of CA that can be used effectively in maize based system of hills and Terai.},

	abstract = {With the aim of identifying appropriate crop establishment methods in cereals-cereals, cereals-legumes, legumes-cereals and legumes-legumes cropping patterns, an experiment was carried out during 2019/20 to 2020/21 in National Agronomy Research Centre, Khumaltar. The experiment was laid out in split plot design with 8 treatments and 3 replications. Main plot was for two tillage methods [Zero tillage (ZT) and conventional tillage (CT)] and sub-plots for 4 different cropping patterns (maize-wheat, maize-lentil, soybean-wheat and soybean-lentil). In zero tillage, the soil was disturbed only along the rows for making seeding furrows and the previous crop residues were left anchored. The rest of the crop management practices were adopted as per the recommended practices. The data were analyzed using GenStat software. The results revealed that tillage treatments did not influence the winter crop yields in 2019, but in 2020, ZT recorded a significantly higher yield of wheat (4.9 Mt ha-1) compared to CT (3.4 Mt ha-1). Similarly, irrespective of crop establishment methods, pooled system yields and benefit: cost ratios were significantly influenced by various cropping patterns. The significantly higher system yield was recorded with maize-wheat (9.0 Mt ha-1) and the least with the soybean-lentil (5.2 Mt ha-1) cropping systems. Improvements in the soil properties were observed as SOM was 14\% higher in ZT compared to CT. Similarly, average soil moisture and soil temperature in ZT and CT were found to be 30.2\%, 27.5 °C and 28.7\%, 29.4 °C, respectively. It is suggested that CA could possibly be an alternative production system for the fragile agro-ecology in the mid-hills of Nepal.},

Results revealed that the grain yield of drydirect seeded rice did not vary due to seedbed preparation methods. However, weedy check treatments reduced more than 92.78 \% of grain yield of dry-direct seeded rice compared to weed-free check. The herbicidal treatments were found to be superior for the benefit-cost ratio. Pendimethalin fb Bispyribac sodium recorded the highest net returns of NRs 68.73 thousand ha-1 and the benefit-cost ratio of 2.55.

Applying Autoregressive-Distributed Lag Regression or ARDL bounds testing approach for analysis of co-integration between the variables, we confirm that there is a long-run relationship among the variables. Furthermore, we employ Granger non-causality tests for robustness. The findings reveal that rainfall has substantial effects on the rice yield. Specifically, a positive and significant relationship exists between rice yields and rainfall and that this relationship is unidirectional. Rainfall impacts on rice yield and holding all things constant, a 1 mm increase in rainfall increases rice yields by 0.65 percent. Given the effects of temperature on rice crops and increasing climate change vulnerabilities, agricultural scientists should focus on research and development of temperature tolerant rice varieties in the production of rice yields.},

Majority of rice cultivated area in south Asia are under rainfed, where water stress at any of the critical growth stage causes sharp decline in yield. Research was conducted in western Nepal at farmers field around the close vicinity of Regional Agriculture Research Center (RARS) Nepalgunj. Ten different rice cultivars were evaluated under drought stress and non-stress condition during the year 2017 to identify superior stress tolerant cultivars. Different drought tolerance indices like stress tolerance (TOL), Stress tolerance index (STI), Stress susceptibility index (SSI), were tested in screening superior rice cultivars. Significant reduction in mean grain yield was observed under drought stress in all rice cultivars under the study. The rice cultivars with high STI values and low TOL and SSI were identified as superior drought tolerant cultivars. Based on results of different tolerance indices, Sukha series of rice, Sukha Dhan 1-6 and Radha-4 showed low TOL and SSI and high STI values and were identified as drought tolerant cultivars. The present study reveals that selection based on drought tolerance indices can be an efficient tool in identification of superior drought tolerant cultivars with higher yield and stability.},

We assess the factors influencing farmers’ choice of climate change adaptation practices and associated impacts on household food security and poverty in Pakistan using comprehensive data from 950 farmers from its major provinces. A probit model was used to investigate the factors influencing the use of climate-change adaptation practices; the censored least absolute deviation (CLAD) was used to analyze the determinants of the number of adaptation practices used; and a propensity score matching (PSM) approach was employed to evaluate the impact of adaptation practices on food security and poverty levels. Adjustment in sowing time (22\% households), use of drought tolerant varieties (15\%) and shifting to new crops (25\%) were the three major adaptation practices used by farmers in the study area. Results show that younger farmers and farmers with higher levels of education are more likely to use these adaptation practices, as do farmers that are wealthier, farm more land and have joint families. The number of adaptation practices used was found to be positively associated with education, male household heads, land size, household size, extension services, access to credit and wealth. Farmers adopting more adaptation practices had higher food security levels (8-13\%) than those who did not, and experienced lower levels of poverty (3-6\%). Climate change adaptation practices at farm level can thereby have significant development outcomes in addition to reducing exposure to weather risks.},

We also explore the consumption patterns of these cereals, considering factors such as regional variations, seasonality, and cultural preferences. Finally, we discuss the challenges and opportunities associated with cereal import and consumption in Nepal, highlighting the significance of this issue for the country's food security and overall well-being. Our findings suggest that Nepal remains heavily dependent on cereal imports to meet domestic demand, and that the consumption patterns of these cereals vary considerably across the country. We conclude with some policy implications and recommendations for enhancing Nepal's cereal industry, promoting self-sufficiency in cereal production, and improving the nutritional status of its population.},

Field experiments were carried out during 2018/19 and 2019/20 growing seasons to evaluate the response of varying N fertilizer rates on growth and yield parameters of two newly released wheat varieties (Borlaug 2020 and Zinc Gahun-1), one promising line (NL 1179) and Vijay as a check variety. Five N levels (i.e. 0, 50,100,150 and 200 kg N ha-1) were applied in the experiment designed in split plot with three replications. Nitrogen levels and genotypes were allocated as main plot and sub plot treatments, respectively. The combined analysis of both growing seasons indicated that, all newly released and promising genotypes performed better than check variety. NL 1179 recorded the highest grain yield followed by Borlaug 2020 and Zinc Gahun-1. A linear increase of grain yield was observed with increased rate of N from 0 to 200 kg ha-1, while 200 kg N ha1showed significantly (p{\textless}0.001) highest grain yield which was statistically at par with 150 kg N/ha. Similarly, gross margin (Rs. 148933 ha-1) was highest with the application of N @ 150 kg ha-1. Interaction effect of genotypes and N levels was not found significant. Thus, it can be concluded that for higher grain production of improved wheat varieties, 150 kg Nha-1could be recommended under Bhairahawa condition.},

Change in temperature, precipitation and composition of gases have greater potentials to affect the crops and they are being affected till date. Severe cases have been seen in different places countrywide. Rarity of different crop varieties like Amaranthus, Millets etc. are all caused due to the climate change. On an average the temperature increase in Nepal was recorded as 0.06°C per year in which increment in Terai and Himalayas was 0.04°C and 0.08°C per year respectively. NARC shows Cold wave due to severe winter in 1998 caused high percentage of yield reduction for potato (27.8\%), leaf mustard (36.5\%), mustard seed (11.2\%), lentil (37.6\%), and chickpea (38\%). Reduction in the potential of productive lands due to floods, landslides and erosion are also the issues at peak. Every year, flood sweeps a huge amount of productive lands in Terai whereas the lands in hills are fallow due to rain deficit. Various steps are being taken by government to adapt to climate change. Several policies are made. Some of the policies are implemented and some are yet to be implemented. But, now is the time to be serious about climate change and to find proper adaptive measures to reduce its effects.},

By using district level secondary data of 25 years, this study finds significant positive impact of the average and maximum temperature and significant negative impact of the minimum temperature on net revenue and wheat yield of the Terai region. Similarly, precipitation has mixed impacts. With the maximum temperature, increase in precipitation reduces net revenue and wheat yield whereas with average and minimum temperature, precipitation increases wheat yields as well as revenue. Other traditional inputs like population density, seed, manure, human labour and tractor used are positively associated with climatic change and increase net revenue as well as wheat yield whereas fertilizer and bullock used are negatively associated with climatic change and reduce net revenue and wheat yield.},

It affects agriculture, forestry, human health, biodiversity, snow coverand aquatic to mountain ecosystems. Changes in climatic factors like temperature, solar radiation and precipitation have potentials to influence crop production. Despite many efforts possible on combating impacts of climate change, there are still difficulties in Nepalese agriculture. With an average of 0.06oC/yea, a rise in temperature from 1975 to 2006 by 1.8oC has been recorded in the country. Problem of frequent drought, severe floods, landslides and mixed type of effects in agricultural crops have been experienced in Nepal because of climate change. Study done on CO2 enrichment technology at Khumaltar revealed that the yield of rice and wheat increased by 26.6\% and 18.4\% due to double CO2, 17.1\% and 8.6\% due to increase in temperature respectively. A crop simulation model (DSSAT) to study the effects of CO2, temperature and rain in NARC showed positive effect in yield of rice and wheat in all regions, but negative effect in maize especially in Terai. In Nepalese agriculture, the time has come for the authorities to find out adaptive measures to mitigate the effects to reduce untold natural calamities and miseries due to recent erratic weather pattern.},

We employ a simultaneous equations model to investigate the diﬀerential eﬀects of adaptation on adapters and non-adapters. An endogenous switching mechanism is employed to account for selectivity bias. Based on a survey of 422 rice farmers in Nepal, our results show that farmers' education, access to credit and extension services, experience with climate change impacts such as drought and ﬂood, information on climate change issues, belief in climate change and the need to adapt all variously determine their decision-making. We ﬁnd that the adaptation strategies employed by farmers signiﬁcantly increase rice yields. Furthermore, results indicate that both adapters and non-adapters would beneﬁt from the adaptation of the identiﬁed strategies. This study, therefore, provides supportive evidence for policy makers to take into consideration farmers' existing knowledge and skills in adapting to climate change. The ﬁndings show that it is imperative to involve farmers in climate change adaptation planning processes if the full beneﬁts of such policy action are to be realized.},

	abstract = {Improved irrigation use efﬁciency is an important tool for intensifying and diversifying agriculture in Nepal, resulting in higher economic yield from irrigated farmlands with a minimum input of water. Research was conducted to evaluate the effect of irrigation method (furrow vs. drip) on the productivity of nutritious fodder species during off-monsoon dry periods in different elevation zones of central Nepal. A split-block factorial design was used. The factors considered were treatment location, fodder crop, and irrigation method. Commonly used local agronomical practices were followed in all respects except irrigation method. Results revealed that location effect was signiﬁcant (p {\textless} 0.01) with highest fodder productivity seen for the middle elevation site, Syangja. Species effects were also signiﬁcant, with teosinte (Euchlaena mexicana) having higher yield than cowpea (Vigna unguiculata). Irrigation method impacted green biomass yield (higher with furrow irrigation) but both methods yielded similar dry biomass, while water use was 73\% less under drip irrigation. Our ﬁndings indicated that the controlled application of water through drip irrigation is able to produce acceptable yields of nutritionally dense fodder species during dry seasons, leading to more effective utilization and resource conservation of available land, fertilizer and water. Higher productivity of these nutritional fodders resulted in higher milk productivity for livestock smallholders. The ability to grow fodder crops year-round in lowland and hill regions of Nepal with limited water storages using low-cost, water-efﬁcient drip irrigation may greatly increase livestock productivity and, hence, the economic security of smallholder farmers.},

Monsoon based rice farming in Banke district has been also affected with changing monsoon pattern. This study summarizes the meteorological data from 1995 to 2016 recorded at weather station in Regional Agricultural Research Station (RARS), Khajura, Banke, Nepal and analyzes its influences in rice yields. In addition, an open top chamber (OTC) study with three types of open top chambers and four rice cultivars was conducted during the rainy season in 2016. The data analysis and field research result revealed that the average rainfall during the monsoon months over 16 years was not consistent. Among the monsoon months, June rainfall significantly related to rice yield and years with higher rainfall in June had higher rice yield. September average maximum temperature increase was found significant whereas sudden increase in maximum temperature caused significant decline in rice yield. From open top chamber study (OTC), increased average daily temperature of 2.50C compared to the ambient conditions had increased rice yield of newly developed varieties and pipelines. In the context of changing climate, high accuracy prediction of weather and climate conditions will help to prepare the cropping calendar and select suitable cultivars and cultivation practices to maintain the rice productivity.},

	abstract = {The concern of climate change has been emphasized in the field of economics too owing to the challenge of adapting to global warming for sustainable development and growth. This challenge becomes dominant in the developing economies like Nepal as these countries face the combination of equator vulnerable climate change pattern, agro-based economy, scarcity of resources, and lack of influence to put forth the global agenda of climate change to international forum. In this paper, we conducted a quantitative modeling of climate change and its impact to the agricultural value addition in Nepal taking into consideration annual series of agricultural gross domestic product (AGDP), rainfall, temperature, seeds and fertilizer distribution data for the period of 36 years ranging from 1975 to 2010. The statistical inferences show the significant positive impact of rainfall to the AGDP. Nevertheless, improved seeds and chemical fertilizers are found to be insignificant. The impact of rising temperature to AGDP is cautious as we find a large negative coefficient of cyclical component of temperature, but statistically insignificant. This insignificance may be due to the nature of very little temperature variability over the study period as compared to the variability in AGDP. The country should assess the impact of climate change in national, regional, and district level to collect the spatial information and underpin the adaptive policies to the required areas.},

	abstract = {The Institute of Agriculture and Animal Sciences (IAAS) has been conducting research on a range of field crops in the central Terai region of Nepal for over 25 years. A review of published and unpublished results of crop research at IAAS was undertaken to identify the nature of the research effort over the past 25 years, and to determine yield gaps and identify future research priorities. On-station research has included 14 crop types, however the main research effort has been on wheat followed by rice, but with some focus also on maize, potatoes, oilseeds, and legumes, and with a small amount of cropping and farming systems research. The main research themes were varietal performance and breeding (especially wheat), crop, soil and water management, weed management (especially in rice) and insect pest and disease management. Potential yields of rice, maize and wheat were 5.5, 4.4, and 5.0 t/ha, respectively, higher than research station yields (3.4, 3.3 and 3.5 t/ha, respectively) and farmers’ yields (2.7, 1.8, and 1.9 t/ha, respectively) in Chitwan. The results suggest that there is great scope to raise yields of all cereals in farmers’ fields, more so for wheat and maize than for rice. Improved agronomical research on rice varieties and crop and soil management are required to reduce the yield gap for rice, while adoption of recommended technologies by farmers would help reduce the wheat yield gap. For soybean, lentil, and potato, the gap between potential and farmer yields is much larger than the other yield gaps, suggesting large scope for increase in yields in farmers’ fields through both improved management and improved varieties. Innovative and new research on eco-region suited variety identification, improved crop and soil management, improved water and N management, agro-meteorology and crop modelling are suggested as priorities for future research to increase productivity and reduce yield gaps of major field crops in the Chitwan district of Nepal.},

	abstract = {Nepal’s economy is largely based on agriculture, predominantly small-scale farming, and about half of which is dependent on natural rainfall. In Nepal, agriculture is a highly climate sensitive sector. Historically, the sector has been affected by floods, droughts and erratic rainfall. This study focused on the impacts and economic costs of climate change in agriculture and assessed perceptions of communities of Kaski and Mustang districts on frequency and intensity of hailstorm events over time including their related impacts. Scenario-based impact assessment was used for assessment of longterm impacts and economic costs of climate change. The study used Decision Support System for Agro-technology Transfer (DSSAT) model to analyze the effects of climate on three major crops, namely rice, maize and wheat. The economic loss due to the impacts of climate change in cereals (rice, maize and wheat) was estimated at around US\$ 336.42 million in the year 2006. Among the respondents, 60\% reported food shortages which made them highly vulnerable due to climate variability. Similarly, 80\% of the respondents mentioned that 20 major hailstorm events have occurred in the vicinity of their communities over the last 35 years (up to 2012) and have caused significant damage to crop production, livestock and infrastructure. DesInventar database reported damage of 75\% to 100\% of the key crops. Crop yield projections indicate a complex mix of increases and decreases in yield which vary over time (in projections in 2030 AD and 2070 AD) and by location (east to west/Terai to Mountains). In the 2030s, there is a net increase in production and values; however, by the 2070s, the impact in agricultural production is expected to reach to US\$ 140 million/year (2014). In terms of research, there are priorities around further work to understand climate uncertainty, the indirect economic costs of these impacts, and early research priorities to address long-term challenges. There is an urgent need to build capacity, with information and awareness raising, monitoring, research, and institutional strengthening.},

Majority of rice cultivated area in south Asia are under rainfed, where water stress at any of the critical growth stage causes sharp decline in yield. Research was conducted in western Nepal at farmers field around the close vicinity of Regional Agriculture Research Center (RARS) Nepalgunj. Ten different rice cultivars were evaluated under drought stress and non-stress condition during the year 2017 to identify superior stress tolerant cultivars. Different drought tolerance indices like stress tolerance (TOL), Stress tolerance index (STI), Stress susceptibility index (SSI), were tested in screening superior rice cultivars. Significant reduction in mean grain yield was observed under drought stress in all rice cultivars under the study. The rice cultivars with high STI values and low TOL and SSI were identified as superior drought tolerant cultivars. Based on results of different tolerance indices, Sukha series of rice, Sukha Dhan 1-6 and Radha-4 showed low TOL and SSI and high STI values and were identified as drought tolerant cultivars. The present study reveals that selection based on drought tolerance indices can be an efficient tool in identification of superior drought tolerant cultivars with higher yield and stability.},

A total of 109,855 hectares of paddy land (7.09\%) remained fallow in 2006/07 as farmers were unable to plant due to drought. In addition, yields were lower by almost 6\%. Paddy crop production consequently declined by 12.5 \% compared to last year. The total food grain shortfall for the year 2006/07 has been calculated at 187,748 Mt assuming favorable weather conditions for the winter crop wheat and barley.},

A cross-sectional data of 184 farmers were collected using a simple random sampling method. A logit regression was used for data analysis. Age of the household head, years of schooling of the household head, presence of fine in monetary terms, number of farmers in a branch of the irrigation system positively motivated farmers in the involvement in the group for the management of the irrigation system. Motivation among farmers for collective action for management of the irrigation system was influenced by a combination of different factors. Therefore, the proper distribution of water at different branches, binding every level of users by law and transparency in the use of the income of the irrigation system must be maintained to achieve the desired results.

	abstract = {Over recent millennia, human populations have regularly reconstructed their subsistence niches, changing both how they obtain food and the conditions in which they live. For example, over the last 12,000 years the vast majority of human populations shifted from foraging to practicing different forms of agriculture. The shift to farming is widely understood to have impacted several aspects of human demography and biology, including mortality risk, population growth, adult body size, and physical markers of health. However, these trends have not been integrated within an over-arching conceptual framework, and there is poor understanding of why populations tended to increase in population size during periods when markers of health deteriorated. Here, we offer a novel conceptual approach based on evolutionary life history theory. This theory assumes that energy availability is ﬁnite and must be allocated in competition between the functions of maintenance, growth, reproduction, and defence. In any given environment, and at any given stage during the life-course, natural selection favours energy allocation strategies that maximise ﬁtness. We argue that the origins of agriculture involved profound transformations in human life history strategies, impacting both the availability of energy and the way that it was allocated between life history functions in the body. Although overall energy supply increased, the diet composition changed, while sedentary populations were challenged by new infectious burdens. We propose that this composite new ecological niche favoured increased energy allocation to defence (immune function) and reproduction, thus reducing the allocation to growth and maintenance. We review evidence in support of this hypothesis and highlight how further work could address both heterogeneity and speciﬁc aspects of the origins of agriculture in more detail. Our approach can be applied to many other transformations of the human subsistence niche, and can shed new light on the way that health, height, life expectancy, and fertility patterns are changing in association with globalization and nutrition transition.},

Since, Nepal does not produce any fertilizers, demand for fertilizers are being met through formal and informal imports. Over the years, fertilizer policy changes have been observed several times in a bid to satisfy farmers' demand for quality fertilizers. While fertilizer policy change of deregulating the fertilizer trade initially produced positive impact in overall supply situation, deregulation policy could not largely ensure the supply of quality fertilizers in required quantity and time. Re-introducing subsidy regime in chemical fertilizer by the government's recent decision could be considered as a positive development towards meeting farmers demand for quality fertilizer. However, given the quota of subsidized fertilizer, which is far less than the actual demand, the problem of supply is likely to continue. To address current problem of short supply government should increase the quota at least up to three hundred thousand metric tons. Moreover, Ministry of Agriculture and Cooperatives should come up with a long-term plan aiming at sustainable management of soil fertility.},

	abstract = {Agricultural production is under threat due to climate change in food insecure regions, especially in Asian countries. Various climate-driven extremes, i.e., drought, heat waves, erratic and intense rainfall patterns, storms, floods, and emerging insect pests have adversely affected the livelihood of the farmers. Future climatic predictions showed a significant increase in temperature, and erratic rainfall with higher intensity while variability exists in climatic patterns for climate extremes prediction. For mid-century (2040–2069), it is projected that there will be a rise of 2.8°C in maximum temperature and a 2.2°C in minimum temperature in Pakistan. To respond to the adverse effects of climate change scenarios, there is a need to optimize the climate-smart and resilient agricultural practices and technology for sustainable productivity. Therefore, a case study was carried out to quantify climate change effects on rice and wheat crops and to develop adaptation strategies for the rice-wheat cropping system during the mid-century (2040–2069) as these two crops have significant contributions to food production. For the quantification of adverse impacts of climate change in farmer fields, a multidisciplinary approach consisted of five climate models (GCMs), two crop models (DSSAT and APSIM) and an economic model [Trade-off Analysis, Minimum Data Model Approach (TOAMD)] was used in this case study. DSSAT predicted that there would be a yield reduction of 15.2\% in rice and 14.1\% in wheat and APSIM showed that there would be a yield reduction of 17.2\% in rice and 12\% in wheat. Adaptation technology, by modification in crop management like sowing time and density, nitrogen, and irrigation application have the potential to enhance the overall productivity and profitability of the rice-wheat cropping system under climate change scenarios. Moreover, this paper reviews current literature regarding adverse climate change impacts on agricultural productivity, associated main issues, challenges, and opportunities for sustainable productivity of agriculture to ensure food security in Asia. Flowing opportunities such as altering sowing time and planting density of crops, crop rotation with legumes, agroforestry, mixed livestock systems, climate resilient plants, livestock and fish breeds, farming of monogastric livestock, early warning systems and decision support systems, carbon sequestration, climate, water, energy, and soil smart technologies, and promotion of biodiversity have the potential to reduce the negative effects of climate change.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            The global increase in the proportion of land cultivated with pollinator‐dependent crops implies increased reliance on pollination services. Yet agricultural practices themselves can profoundly affect pollinator supply and pollination. Extensive monocultures are associated with a limited pollinator supply and reduced pollination, whereas agricultural diversification can enhance both. Therefore, areas where agricultural diversity has increased, or at least been maintained, may better sustain high and more stable productivity of pollinator‐dependent crops. Given that {\textgreater}80\% of all crops depend, to varying extents, on insect pollination, a global increase in agricultural pollinator dependence over recent decades might have led to a concomitant increase in agricultural diversification. We evaluated whether an increase in the area of pollinator‐dependent crops has indeed been associated with an increase in agricultural diversity, measured here as crop diversity, at the global, regional, and country scales for the period 1961–2016. Globally, results show a relatively weak and decelerating rise in agricultural diversity over time that was largely decoupled from the strong and continually increasing trend in agricultural dependency on pollinators. At regional and country levels, there was no consistent relationship between temporal changes in pollinator dependence and crop diversification. Instead, our results show heterogeneous responses in which increasing pollinator dependence for some countries and regions has been associated with either an increase or a decrease in agricultural diversity. Particularly worrisome is a rapid expansion of pollinator‐dependent oilseed crops in several countries of the Americas and Asia that has resulted in a decrease in agricultural diversity. In these regions, reliance on pollinators is increasing, yet agricultural practices that undermine pollination services are expanding. Our analysis has thereby identified world regions of particular concern where environmentally damaging practices associated with large‐scale, industrial agriculture threaten key ecosystem services that underlie productivity, in addition to other benefits provided by biodiversity.},

	abstract = {Irrigation-led farming system intensiﬁcation and efﬁcient use of ground and surface water resources are currently being championed as a crucial ingredient for achieving food security and reducing poverty in Nepal. The potential scope and sustainability of irrigation interventions under current and future climates however remains poorly understood. Potential adaptation options in Western Nepal were analyzed using bias-corrected Regional Climate Model (RCM) data and the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model. The RCM climate change scenario suggested that average annual rainfall will increase by about 4\% with occurrence of increased number and intensity of rainfall events in the winter. RCM outputs also suggested that average annual maximum temperature could decrease by 1.4 ◦C, and average annual minimum temperature may increase by 0.3 ◦C from 2021 to 2050. Similarly, average monthly streamﬂow volume could increase by about 65\% from March–April, although it could decrease by about 10\% in June. Our results highlight the tight hydrological coupling of surface and groundwater. Farmers making use of surface water for irrigation in upstream subbasins may inadvertently cause a decrease in average water availability in downstream subbasins at approximately 14 \%, which may result in increased need to abstract groundwater to compensate for deﬁcits. Well-designed irrigated crop rotations that fully utilize both surface and groundwater conversely may increase groundwater levels by an average of 45 mm from 2022 to 2050, suggesting that in particular subbasins the cultivation of two crops a year may not cause long-term groundwater depletion. Modeled crop yield for the winter and spring seasons were however lower under future climate change scenarios, even with sufﬁcient irrigation application. Lower yields were associated with shortened growing periods and high temperature stress. Irrigation intensiﬁcation appears to be feasible if both surface and groundwater resources are appropriately targeted and rationally used. Conjunctive irrigation planning is required for equitable and year-round irrigation supply as neither the streamﬂow nor groundwater can provide full and year-round irrigation for intensiﬁed cropping systems without causing the degradation of natural resources.},

	abstract = {This paper investigates how climate change can affect agricultural production and proposes some adaptation measures that could be undertaken to mitigate the negative effects of climate change while enhancing the positive ones. The paper stresses the importance of planned adaptation measures and highlights possible strategies for reducing risk and improving resilience. To quantify the possible effects of climate change and the effects of adaptation measures this study uses the International Model for Policy Analysis of Agricultural Commodities and Trade (IMPACT). The analysis first explores the potential effects of climate change on yields and prices. It then goes on to analyse the potential impacts of two distinctive sets of adaptation strategies on yields, prices, and food security, namely: i) research and development (to develop new crop varieties that are better suited to changed climate conditions) and ii) changes in irrigation technology. Last, the analysis in this paper estimates the public and private investment needs in research and development (R\&D) for developing new crop varieties, and further develops estimates of the cost of improving irrigation technologies in OECD countries. The OECD Secretariat would like to thank the International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI) for providing OECD with access to the IMPACT model.

	abstract = {Agricultural inputs have crucial role to deliver increased productivity and sustained agricultural growth in an economy. However, adequate empirical research is not available related to effects of agricultural inputs use on agricultural productivity in Nepalese context. Thus, empirical study was conducted so as to reveal the effects of agricultural inputs use in agricultural production sector. This study utilized time series data of 30 years (1990 to 2019) retrieved from various secondary data sources of agricultural input supply in Nepal. Then, data obtained were processed and analyzed in two ways: First, Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of different agricultural inputs were estimated using Log-Lin regression model. Second, the parameters estimates of Cobb-Douglas regression analysis was obtained taking Agricultural GDP as the dependent variable and independent variables viz. cultivated area, irrigated area, population engaged in agriculture, fertilizer consumption, pesticides application, improved seeds used and government expenditure. The results depicted that growth rate of various agricultural inputs use had raised significantly and was in increasing trend during the study period. Furthermore, cultivated area, irrigated area and pesticides application were found statistically significant and had significant impact on growth of agricultural GDP (Gross Domestic Product).},

	abstract = {This paper estimates the impact of climate change on Indian agriculture. I use a 40-year district-level panel data set covering over 200 Indian districts to estimate the e¤ect of random year-to-year variation in weather on agricultural output. These panel estimates incorporate farmers’within-year adaptations to annual weather shocks. These estimates, derived from short-run weather e¤ects, are relevant for predicting the medium-run economic impact of climate change if farmers are unable to adapt quickly. I …nd that projected climate change over the period 2010-2039 reduces major crop yields by 4.5 to 9 percent. The long-run (2070-2099) impact is dramatic, reducing yields by 25 percent or more in the absence of long-run adaptation. These results suggest that climate change is likely to impose signi…cant costs on the Indian economy unless farmers can quickly recognize and adapt to increasing temperatures. Such rapid adaptation may be less plausible in a developing country, where access to information and capital is limited.},

This report is prepared by studying different journal articles, reports, books and newspapers. Among ICT tools mobile phone is the most used ICT tools by farmers and laptop is the most used ICT tools used by the organizations for data processing. Radio and television are more popular in rural areas. This study shows that most of the ICT users are confined in urban areas. There are many advantages of the use of ICT tools in the field of agriculture. ICT tools can cover a large number of the population with high speed. ICT tools increase productivity, sustainability and efficiency of farms by providing relevant information timely and more easily. ICT tools provide information about quality seeds, transportation, marketing, new technologies and weather condition that facilitate the farmers for making the right decision. There are many agriculture-related mobile applications available at Google play store. These mobile apps give knowledge about cropping methods, crop management practices, crop protection, the market price of inputs and outputs etc. These mobile apps are managed in Nepali language for facilitating the Nepali farmers. Agriculture-related programs are broadcasted through national television channels and FM radio stations. There are technical, socio-economic, institutional and infrastructural constraints that limit the use of ICTs in agriculture fields.},

	abstract = {Potato growth, yield, and quality under improved irrigation methods and non-uniformity of their irrigation applications are important to enhance water management in arid regions. A field experiment was conducted in 2014 spring and fall growing seasons using potato (Solanum tuberosum) grown in northern Egypt at Shibin El Kom, Menofia, Egypt to evaluate potato response to furrow or trickle irrigation. A Randomized Split-Plot Design with irrigation method randomly distributed and non-uniformity of irrigation applications evaluated along either irrigation furrow or trickle lateral as dependent variables measured at the 3rd, 13th, 23rd, 33rd, 43rd and 53rd m along the 55 m irrigation line. Traditional (TF) and partial (PF) furrows as well as trickle point (TP) and line (TL) sources were used as irrigation methods. Each treatment was repeated three times. For a 33rd m treatment, seasonal optimum water use by potato was 328, 234, 269 and 292 mm over 118 days in spring and 200, 164, 178 and 186 mm over 122 days in fall under TF, PF, TP and TL irrigation methods, respectively. Potato tuber yield and quality were significantly affected by growing season (S), irrigation method (I) and non-uniformity of irrigation application (U). Tuber yield, total soluble solid (TSS) and leaf area index (LAI) were significantly affected by I and U, and their interaction I * U; harvest index (HI) was not affected by I but U. Except for TSS by S * I and HI by U * I and S * I, results showed no significant differences. Moreover, tuber weight, number and marketable yield were significantly affected by S, I, U and I * U interaction, except medium tuber size and culls by S. A given 33rd treatment under partial furrow and trickle irrigation, relative to that of traditional furrow, enhanced tuber yield and improved quality in both growing seasons. In non-uniform irrigation application over two growing seasons, potato crop response was developed under varied irrigation methods. Tuber yields were significantly affected in a linear relationship (r2 ≥ 0.75) by either water deficit or excessive water under irrigation methods.},

While scientific knowledge on climate threats and changing climate patterns are essential, it is also important to consider the impacts in relation to how the threats are perceived and handled by local people. This paper intends to assess the trend and people’s perception on temperature and precipitation. Three focus groups’ discussion and a total number of 240 households were interviewed during field visit. The collected information was scaled from the least preferred-1 to the most preferred-5 based on their preferences. The trend of mean of annual average, maximum and minimum temperature indicates that the temperature has increased significantly and precipitation intensity and magnitude are also in increasing trend in the monsoon and postmonsoon seasons which may raise the extreme flood events. These facts were verified with the people’s perception. This finding could be useful for formulation of effective flood management policy and plan in this river basin as well as very applicable for other similar areas.},

This study was conducted to determine the effects of different rates of nitrogen and varieties on growth and yield of hybrid maize in Lamahi Municipality, Dang, Nepal from June to October, 2019. Three levels of hybrid maize varieties (10V10, Rajkumar F1 and NMH-731) and four levels of nitrogen (160, 180, 200 and 220 kg N ha-1) were evaluated using two factorial randomized complete block design with three replications. The results showed that grain yield and yield attributing traits of hybrid maize varieties increased with the increasing level of nitrogen from 160 to 220 kg ha-1. The application of nitrogen @ 220 kg N ha-1 produced the highest grain yield (10.07 t ha-1), cob length (16.33 cm), no of rows per cob (14.97), no of grains per row (33.37), cob diameter (4.54), thousand grain weight (276.77 g), stover yield (12.91 t ha-1), biological yield (23.00 t ha-1), harvest index (43.80), gross return (NRs. 208940 ha-1), net return (NRs.104488 ha-1) and B:C ratio (2.001). The hybrid maize variety 10V10 produced the highest grain yield (9.35 t ha-1), net returns (NRs. 91740.66 ha-1) and B:C ratio (1.91) accompanied by the highest cob length (16.25 cm), and as number of grains per row (32.35) as compared to other varieties. This study suggested that maize production can be maximized by cultivating hybrid maize variety 10V10 with the use of 220 kg N ha-1 in inner Terai region of Nepal.},

The results showed an average growth rate of GDP, agricultural land, working force and GFCF to be 3.9\%, 0.8\%, 1.5\% and 7.9\%, respectively, with the values plummeting in 2015/16, due to occurrence of the devastating earthquake in 2015, but then again variable values skyrocketed following years. The regression analysis found that GDP was affected significantly by agricultural land and working force, but insignificant with GFCF. On an average, with the increase in agricultural land and working force by 1 \%, GDP increased by 1.1\% and 1.7\%, respectively. Thus, policy regarding an increment of agricultural land use and employment of labour force must be framed to improve the Nepalese economy.},

	abstract = {Much research has been carried out on modelling soil erosion rates under different climatic and land use conditions. Although some studies have addressed the issue of reduced crop productivity due to soil erosion, few have focused on the economic loss in terms of agricultural production and gross domestic product (GDP). In this study, soil erosion modellers and economists come together to carry out an economic evaluation of soil erosion in the European Union (EU). The study combines biophysical and macroeconomic models to estimate the cost of agricultural productivity loss due to soil erosion by water in the EU. The soil erosion rates, derived from the RUSLE2015 model, are used to estimate the loss in crop productivity (physical change in the production of plants) and to model their impact on the agricultural sector per country. A computable general equilibrium model is then used to estimate the impact of crop productivity change on agricultural production and GDP. The 12 million hectares of agricultural areas in the EU that suffer from severe erosion are estimated to lose around 0.43\% of their crop productivity annually. The annual cost of this loss in agricultural productivity is estimated at around €1.25 billion. The computable general equilibrium model estimates the cost in the agricultural sector to be close to €300 million and the loss in GDP to be about €155 million. Italy emerges as the country that suffers the highest economic impact, whereas the agricultural sector in most Northern and Central European countries is only marginally affected by soil erosion losses.},

NASA-POWER derived weather data of Taulihawa in Kapilbastu (27.55˚ N, 83.667˚ E) district in central Terai for the past 32–33 years (1984/85-2017/18) were purposively selected and downloaded and validated with recorded weather data (1985/86, 1995/96, 2005/06 and 2015/16) of Department of Hydrology and Meteorology (DHM). The trend analysis for grain yield of wheat yield in Kapilvastu was drawn with the historical data of maximum and minimum temperatures and rainfall. Positive correlations between grain yields and minimum temperature and rainfall each showed an acceptable coefficient of determinations (R2). The Cropping system Model - Crop Environment Resource Synthesis (CSM-CERES)- Wheat model, embedded in Decision Support Systems for Agro-technology Transfer (DSSAT) ver 4.7 was used for multi-year predictions of wheat yields using both historically recorded and simulated climatic scenarios. Model simulated results closely agreed with the observed wheat yields recorded by the Ministry of Agriculture and Livestock Development (MoALD) in Nepal. The correlation coefficient of minimum temperature and wheat yield was 0.272 (p{\textless}0.05). The correlation between precipitation and observed and DSSAT simulated wheat yield were 0.379 (p{\textless}0.01). The multi-year predicted wheat yields using the historical weather data and by the use of the International Panel on Climate Change (IPCC, 2007) scenario embedded in DSSAT crop model showed that yield of wheat could be sustained with use of the current crop cultivars only for 2050 scenarios. Agro-climatic index, mainly temperature, was found to be more sensitive to wheat production in the Nepalese central-west Terai region. This study suggests for the development of new temperature and drought tolerant ready wheat cultivars to feed the increasingly growing Nepalese population.},

	abstract = {The relation between climate and maize production in Nepal was studied for the period 1970/71-2007/08. Due to the topographical differences within north-south span of the country, Nepal has wide variety of climatic condition. About 70 to 90\% of the rainfall occurs during summer monsoon (June to September) and the rest of the months are almost dry. Maize is cultivated from March to May depending on the rainfall distribution. Due to the availability of improved seeds, the maize yield has been steadily increasing after 1987/1988. The national area and yield of maize is estimated to be 870,166ha and 2159kg/ha respectively in 2007/08. The present rate of annual increase of temperature is 0.04°C in Nepal. Trends of temperature rise are not uniform throughout Nepal. An increase of annual temperature at Rampur during 1968-2008 was only 0.039°C. However, at Rampur during the maize growing seasons, March/April - May, the trend of annual maximum temperature had not been changed, but during the month of June and July, the trend of increase of maximum temperature was 0.03°C to 0.04°C /year.Key words: Climate-change; Global-warming; Hill; Mountain; Nepal; TaraiThe Journal of  AGRICULTURE AND ENVIRONMENT Vol. 11, 2010Page: 59-69Uploaded Date: 15 September, 2010},

This study was conducted to determine the effects of different rates of nitrogen and varieties on growth and yield of hybrid maize in Lamahi Municipality, Dang, Nepal from June to October, 2019. Three levels of hybrid maize varieties (10V10, Rajkumar F1 and NMH-731) and four levels of nitrogen (160, 180, 200 and 220 kg N ha-1) were evaluated using two factorial randomized complete block design with three replications. The results showed that grain yield and yield attributing traits of hybrid maize varieties increased with the increasing level of nitrogen from 160 to 220 kg ha-1. The application of nitrogen @ 220 kg N ha-1 produced the highest grain yield (10.07 t ha-1), cob length (16.33 cm), no of rows per cob (14.97), no of grains per row (33.37), cob diameter (4.54), thousand grain weight (276.77 g), stover yield (12.91 t ha-1), biological yield (23.00 t ha-1), harvest index (43.80), gross return (NRs. 208940 ha-1), net return (NRs.104488 ha-1) and B:C ratio (2.001). The hybrid maize variety 10V10 produced the highest grain yield (9.35 t ha-1), net returns (NRs. 91740.66 ha-1) and B:C ratio (1.91) accompanied by the highest cob length (16.25 cm), and as number of grains per row (32.35) as compared to other varieties. This study suggested that maize production can be maximized by cultivating hybrid maize variety 10V10 with the use of 220 kg N ha-1 in inner Terai region of Nepal.},

	abstract = {Climate change-related natural hazards severely affect farmers’ livelihoods. This study explores how farmers in the vulnerable western lowlands of Nepal are affected by floods, heatwaves, and cold spells, how they adapt, and the factors influencing their risk perception and intended adaptation behaviour. Data were collected through a survey of 350 randomly selected farming households from the Banke and Bardiya districts in the Tarai region. Farmers identified environmental risks as the most severe risks to their agricultural production, and their main adaptation strategies, including changes to planting dates and crop varieties and increasing the use of fertilisers and pesticides. Following protection motivation theory and using structural equation modelling, we found that farmers’ risk perception and adaptation behaviour in response to three specific hazards (floods, heatwaves, and cold spells). The flood impact model showed that self-efficacy, perceived responsibility, response cost, trust, and concern partially influenced flood risk perception. These, in turn, mediated affected farmers’ intended flood adaptation strategies. Flood damage experience thoroughly explained flood adaptation behaviour and was mediated by flood risk perception. Risk perception of flood has the significant mediation effects in the flood model, but heatwave and cold spell risk perception did not have any mediation effect in neither the heatwave nor the cold spells models. We attribute this discrepancy to the fact that slow and rapid onset hazards are perceived differently. These problems were compounded by farmers also lacking both awareness and the requisite knowledge of how to deal with the impacts of the climate change related slow-onset hazards that will become more frequent as climate change continues, unabated. These differences will need to be accommodated in sus­ tainable was in community awareness and disaster management programs to increase adaptive and resilient community capacity for the future.},

Farmers are growing mustard crop under energy starved condition and these are main reasons for low productivity of mustard. With a view to address these issues, an experiment on sustainability of productivity in rice-mustard sequential cropping system through integrated nutrient management for terai condition of Nepal was carried at Nawalpur, Sarlahi during 2004 –2006. The result revealed that rice grown with 100\% recommended dose of fertilizer and 10 tons compost /ha produced a maximum mean grain yield of 4371 kg/ha and straw yield of 5045.5 kg/ha which might be due to maximum dry matter accumulation. Likewise, it was exhibited that application of recommended dose of fertilizer with 10 t compost on preceding rice resulted in maximum seed yield of mustard (1259 kg/ha). The finding also showed that mustard grown with recommended dose of fertilizer produced a maximum mean seed yield of 1384 kg/ha. There was a positive effect of these treatments on seed yield attributes and seed yield of succeeding mustard. Economic analysis for the effects of treatments resulted a maximum benefit cost (BC) ratio of 2.0 which was obtained for mustard when grown after recommended dose of fertilizer. An encouraging BC ratio of 3.45 was found when mustard was taken with 100\% recommended dose of fertilize (RDF).},

We found declining trends in SSD (i.e., solar dimming) across Nepal at a rate of –0.20\% per year, with the highest decline occurring during the post-monsoon season (–0.33\% per year), followed by the premonsoon season (–0.24\% per year). A close look at individual stations indicated that declines in pre- and post-monsoon seasons are common regional phenomena. By region, dimming was pronounced (–0.56\% per year) in the plains at 0–300 m above sea level and gradually diminished as elevation rose. The NRD for the same 13 stations showed a significant declining trend (–0.20\% per year), which suggests that the change in NRD is not a major driver of the decreased SSD in Nepal. We argue that the decline in SSD might be influenced by transboundary air pollution from the Indian subcontinent and biomass burning across the region as suggested by other studies.},

	abstract = {The coming 10–20 years will be most critical for making the transition to a global food system in which mineral nutrients in agriculture must be managed in a more holistic manner. Fertilizers play a particular role in that because they are among the key drivers for securing global food security and improving human nutrition through increased crop yields and nutritional quality. A new paradigm for responsible plant nutrition follows a food systems and circular economy approach to achieve multiple socioeconomic, environmental and health objec­ tives. Achieving that requires utilizing all available organic and inorganic nutrient sources with high efficiency, tailored to the specific features of food systems and agroecosystems in different world regions. Critical actions include: (i) sustainability-driven nutrient roadmaps, (ii) digital crop nutrition solutions, (iii) nutritious crops, (iv) nutrient recovery and recycling, (v) climate-smart fertilizers, and (vi) accelerated innovation. The outcome of this transformation will be a new societal plant nutrition optimum rather than a purely economic optimum. New partnerships and sustainability-focused business models will create added value for all actors in the nutrient chain and benefit farmers as well as consumers. Research needs to become more problem-driven and merge excellent science with entrepreneurial innovation approaches in order to develop robust solutions faster and at larger scale. Evidence-based policies should focus on creating and supporting the necessary nutrient stewardship roadmaps, including realistic national targets, progressive regulation and incentives that support technology and business innovation.},

The seven treatments were studied in a randomized complete block design with four replications: T1: 100\% recommended dose of inorganic fertilizer (RDIF) (i.e., 100:60:40 NPK kg ha-1); T2: 50\% RDIF+ FYM @ 9.9 Mt ha-1; T3: 50\% RDIF+ FYM @ 31.3 Mt ha-1; T4: 50\% RDIF+ FYM @ 11.05 Mt ha-1; T5: FYM @ 19.83 Mt ha-1. The results indicated that combined application of chemical fertilizers and farmyard manure was found to have a significant effect on the number of effective tillers per m-2 and grain yield of rice. There was no significant interaction between thousand grain weight and sterility percent. The highest grain yield of 3,453.69 kg ha-1 and the highest number of effective tillers per m-2 (299) were found in the application of 50\% RDIF+ FYM @ 31.3 Mt ha-1. The application of the highest level of FYM alone improved the soil properties. The highest values of available soil organic carbon (34.67 Mt ha-1), available soil nitrogen (1.24 Mt ha1), and available soil phosphorus (39.57 kg ha-1) at a depth of 0–15 cm were found with the application of FYM @ 62.5 Mt ha-1.

	abstract = {A field trial was conducted at Fulbari, Chitwan in 2017 to evaluate the growth, productivity and economics of rice production under different nutrient management practices. Trial was laid out in a split-plot design with five replications. The main plot factor consisted of two rice varieties (Radha-4; improved variety and Arize Tej Gold; a popular Hybrid) and subplot factor consisted of five different nutrient management practices farmers‘ applied dose (FAD;0-20:0-15:0-18 NPK kg ha-1), government recommended dose (GRD; 100:30:30 NPK kg ha1), NARC recommended dose (NRD; 120:60:40 NPK kg ha-1), LCC based N and NE® based P, K dose (LCC-N+NE-P,K; 90-115:5-22:17-50 NPK kg ha-1 for Radha-4 and 90-140:5-36:38-73 NPK kg ha-1 for Arize Tej Gold), Nutrient Expert® based NPK dose (NED; 93-109:5-22:17-50 NPK kg ha-1 for Radha-4 and 118-125:5-36:38-73 NPK kg ha-1 for Arize Tej Gold). Data regarding biometrical, phenological, and yield attributes were recorded at regular intervals. Results revealed that different nutrient management practices had a significant influence on growth, yield attributes, and yield of rice. Number of effective tillers per square meter (215.62), number of grains per panicle (132.52), panicle length (27.02 cm) was recorded higher in LCC-N+NE-P, K. Similarly, a number of grains per panicle and panicle length in LCC-N+NE-P, K were statistically similar to NED. Significantly higher grain yield (5.19 Mt ha1) and straw yield (6.43 Mt ha-1) were recorded in LCC-N+NE-P, K compared to FAD but statistically similar to NED. Higher Benefit-cost (B:C) ratio (2.41) was obtained in LCC-N + NE – P, K which was statistically similar to FAD and NED. Thus, the combined use of LCC and Nutrient Expert software for nutrient management in rice was found productive and profitable in western Chitwan.},

Different components of socio-economic survey include socio-economic status soil agronomic practices cropping status and soil sampling to achieve the target of qualitative and quantitative data for Crop diversification, economic status and socio-economy of farmers from Punjab. There were various parameters related to cropping pattern, livestock production and other suitable parameters related to Agriculture farming for the livelihood status and economic viability. The study was conducted under Rural Agricultural Work Experience programme by the students of Agriculture from University Institute of Agriculture Sciences, Chandigarh University Gharuan (Mohali) Punjab. In this study more than two hundred farmers were involved with proper questionnaire and thorough interaction of students. Questionnaire contains the information about the Socio-economic profile, Crop diversity and economic viability of farmers. Socio-economic profile includes the farmer’s family composition, academic qualifications, caste system, income per-cent, and land holding capacity and other important information, social participation, source of information about agricultural information, extension activities. Proper surveys were conducted in which the interaction was done with the farmers at their houses in the form of interview from the survey conducted it is concluded that the literacy rate of the different villages is about ninety per cent. Nearly forty five per cent (45\%) of the village farmers are medium farmers and 30\% of the farmer’s marginal farmers and other farmers have leased the land for farming. About 90\% were present on social media platforms and 10\% are not present on social media. Besides that main focus was to identifying problem of the area and their solution. Therefore to sustain agriculture and solve some of the visible problems different campaigns rallies and farmers awareness cum training program were organised by our students in collaboration with Krishi Vigyan Kendra, Kurali (GADVASU, Ludhiana) and department of agriculture Punjab by presenting different models various extension activities and providing nourishment at University level. The farmers were addressed for their major crop issues and were made aware about various innovative ideas promoted by Students, KVKs, rural societies and other NGOs. Majority of the farmers are lacking knowledge about latest technologies, rain water harvesting techniques and application of bio-control. Adequate policies prioritization of agricultural components and utmost utilization of resources are prime need.},

The authors' models show that for the three most important grain crops—wheat, rice, and maize—yield lost to insects will increase by 10 to 25\% per degree Celsius of warming, hitting hardest in the temperate zone. These findings provide an estimate of further potential climate impacts on global food supply and a benchmark for future regional and field-specific studies of crop-pest-climate interactions.

            Insect pests substantially reduce yields of three staple grains—rice, maize, and wheat—but models assessing the agricultural impacts of global warming rarely consider crop losses to insects. We use established relationships between temperature and the population growth and metabolic rates of insects to estimate how and where climate warming will augment losses of rice, maize, and wheat to insects. Global yield losses of these grains are projected to increase by 10 to 25\% per degree of global mean surface warming. Crop losses will be most acute in areas where warming increases both population growth and metabolic rates of insects. These conditions are centered primarily in temperate regions, where most grain is produced.},

	abstract = {Significance
            Agriculture was a transformative development in the history of human societies and natural environments and drove the evolution of new domesticated species. Crop plants are the predominant domesticated species in most agricultural systems and are an essential component in all the food production systems that underpinned the development of urban societies. Archaeological plant remains provide a range of insights into the processes by which plants were domesticated in different parts of the world. The present paper provides a unique synthesis of evidence, including quantitative evidence on the trajectory and rate of domestication in seed crops and patterns in the development of tropical vegetatively propagated crops.
          , 
            Recent increases in archaeobotanical evidence offer insights into the processes of plant domestication and agricultural origins, which evolved in parallel in several world regions. Many different crop species underwent convergent evolution and acquired domestication syndrome traits. For a growing number of seed crop species, these traits can be quantified by proxy from archaeological evidence, providing measures of the rates of change during domestication. Among domestication traits, nonshattering cereal ears evolved more quickly in general than seed size. Nevertheless, most domestication traits show similarly slow rates of phenotypic change over several centuries to millennia, and these rates were similar across different regions of origin. Crops reproduced vegetatively, including tubers and many fruit trees, are less easily documented in terms of morphological domestication, but multiple lines of evidence outline some patterns in the development of vegecultural systems across the New World and Old World tropics. Pathways to plant domestication can also be compared in terms of the cultural and economic factors occurring at the start of the process. Whereas agricultural societies have tended to converge on higher population densities and sedentism, in some instances cultivation began among sedentary hunter–gatherers whereas more often it was initiated by mobile societies of hunter–gatherers or herder–gatherers.},

	abstract = {Soil fertility degradation has become a major problem for agricultural management in Nepal. A detailed soil fertility status of different VDCs of Sunsari district was investigated during 2015 and soil related crop production constraints were identified for proper utilization of agricultural land. Total 131 numbers of geo-referenced (GPS based) composite surface soil samples (0-15 cm) were collected from eleven Village Development Committees of Sunsari District. The sample points were recorded with a differential global position system and mapped using Geographic Information System (GIS). Soils were analyzed for mechanical composition, pH, organic matter, total nitrogen, available phosphorus, potassium and micronutrients like Boron, Zinc, Copper and Iron. About 38.9\% soils were found to be silty clay loam, 20.6\% were silty clay, 19.1\% were clay loam and 21.4\% were of other textural classes. Most of the soils were acidic and only few were neutral and slightly alkaline in nature. Soil Organic matter varies from 3.57\% to 0.28\% with a mean value of 1.53 \%. The mean total nitrogen, available phosphorus, potassium was found to be 0.08\%, 44.37 kg/ha and 128.04 kg/ha respectively. The mean hot water extractable Boron, DTPA extractable Copper, Zinc and Iron was found to be 0.14, 0.06, 0.15 and 10.71 mg/kg respectively. Thematic maps were prepared for each soil parameters using ArcGis10.1 software and ordinary Kriging interpolation was used in order to predict values for not sampled locations. The fertility maps provide the readymade source of information about soil fertility status and serve as the decision making tool for successful raising and development of crops. It can be concluded from the above study that GPS and GIS based soil fertility maps helps farmers, scientists, planners and students in providing soil test based fertilizer recommendation for intensive and sustainable site specific crop production.},

The benefit cost ratio (1.43) indicates that mustard production was profitable with productivity of 0.81 ton per ha. The magnitude of regression coefficients of mustard implied that use of human labor, tractor, nutrient and irrigation and pesticides costs had significant positive effect on gross return with estimated increasing return to scale (1.03). According to estimated allocative efficiency indices, it is suggested to increase use of tractor labor, seed, nutrient and irrigation plus pesticides cost by about 47\%, 82\%, 84\% and 94\%, respectively. Extension of modern technologies with adjustment on resource use is to be encouraged for increase in productivity and profit from mustard production which indirectly promotes and ensure forage for pollinators.},

Nepal should increase the production and productivity of agricultural commodities and make investment in agricultural sector rather than in non-productive sector to reduce the increasing agricultural import and jack up the export. In addition people also change their food habit and use the products of own products rather than giving emphasis to foreign goods.},

@article{teamRoleWomenAgriculture,
	title = {The {Role} of {Women} in {Agriculture}},
	abstract = {Agriculture can be an important engine of growth and poverty reduction. But the sector is underperforming in many countries in part because women, who are often a crucial resource in agriculture and the rural economy, face constraints that reduce their productivity. In this paper we draw on the available empirical evidence to study in which areas and to what degree women participate in agriculture. Aggregate data shows that women comprise about 43 percent of the agricultural labour force globally and in developing countries. But this figure masks considerable variation across regions and within countries according to age and social class. Time use surveys, which are more comprehensive but typically not nationally representative, add further insight into the substantial heterogeneity among countries and within countries in women’s contribution to agriculture. They show that female time-use in agriculture varies also by crop, production cycle, age and ethnic group. A few time-use surveys have data by activity and these show that in general weeding and harvesting were predominantly female activities. Overall the labour burden of rural women exceeds that of men, and includes a higher proportion of unpaid household responsibilities related to preparing food and collecting fuel and water. The contribution of women to agricultural and food production is significant but it is impossible to verify empirically the share produced by women. Women’s participation in rural labour markets varies considerably across regions, but invariably women are over represented in unpaid, seasonal and part-time work, and the available evidence suggests that women are often paid less than men, for the same work. Available data on rural and agricultural feminization shows that this is not a general trend but mainly a sub-Saharan Africa phenomena, as well as observed in some sectors such as unskilled labour in the fruit, vegetable and cut-flower export sector. This paper re-affirms that women make essential contributions to agriculture and rural enterprises across the developing world. But there is much diversity in women’s roles and over-generalization undermines policy relevance and planning. The context is important and policies must be based on sound data and gender analysis.},

Thus, irrigation is important to sustaining the country's economy. While irrigation has been practiced for decades, there is considerable need both to expand the currently irrigated area and to improve the efficiency of existing systems. There is no question that for the future economic development of an agrarian country like Nepal, irrigation development and management must play an important part. This paper reviews the potential of large- to medium-size irrigation projects in the Terai, small-size irrigation projects in the hill areas, groundwater development, farmer-managed irrigation systems, and rehabilitation of existing irrigation projects. The role of irrigation as a means of expansion of production and income of the country and institutional implications is also discussed. It should, however, be noted that before major irrigation projects can be developed, treaties with India have to be negotiated for using the waters of international rivers. Thus, realistically, it is somewhat unlikely that major developments will occur before the year 2000.},

	abstract = {Climate change is happening due to natural factors and human activities. It expressively alters biodiversity, agricultural production, and food security. Mainly, narrowly adapted and endemic species are under extinction. Accordingly, concerns over species extinction are warranted as it provides food for all life forms and primary health care for more than 60–80\% of humans globally. Nevertheless, the impact of climate change on biodiversity and food security has been recognized, little is explored compared to the magnitude of the problem globally. Therefore, the objectives of this review are to identify, appraise, and synthesize the link between climate change, biodiversity, and food security. Data, climatic models, emission, migration, and extinction scenarios, and outputs from previous publications were used. Due to climate change, distributions of species have shifted to higher elevations at a median rate of 11.0 m and 16.9 km per decade to higher latitudes. Accordingly, extinction rates of 1103 species under migration scenarios, provide 21–23\% with unlimited migration and 38–52\% with no migration. When an environmental variation occurs on a timescale shorter than the life of the plant any response could be in terms of a plastic phenotype. However, phenotypic plasticity could buffer species against the long-term effects of climate change. Furthermore, climate change affects food security particularly in communities and locations that depend on rain-fed agriculture. Crops and plants have thresholds beyond which growth and yield are compromised. Accordingly, agricultural yields in Africa alone could be decline by more than 30\% in 2050. Therefore, solving food shortages through bringing extra land into agriculture and exploiting new fish stocks is a costly solution, when protecting biodiversity is given priority. Therefore, mitigating food waste, compensating food-insecure people conserving biodiversity, effective use of genetic resources, and traditional ecological knowledge could decrease further biodiversity loss, and meet food security under climate change scenarios. However, achieving food security under such scenario requires strong policies, releasing high-yielding stress resistant varieties, developing climate resilient irrigation structures, and agriculture. Therefore, degraded land restoration, land use changes, use of bio-energy, sustainable forest management, and community based biodiversity conservation are recommended to mitigate climate change impacts.},

	abstract = {This paper assesses the origins of and changes to fertilizer policy in Nepal over a period of time. It assesses farmers’ awareness of the recent changes to the subsidy policy and examines their perceptions of the extension services. This paper looks at the environmental implications of the concentrated application of chemical fertilizer, particularly as far as food security is concerned. Questionnaire surveys, group discussions, a workshop, soil analyses and archival materials were used to collect data for this study. Changes in fertilizer policy have occurred in four different phases: (i) without subsidy; (ii) with subsidy; (iii) with deregulation of fertilizer trade; and (iv) the current phase of subsidies for fertilizer. However, timely and effective fertilizer distribution by the government has always been a problem. Only few farmers (12 \%) know about recent changes in the fertilizer policy; most of them (44 \%) were satisfied with the new subsidy scheme. Valid proof of land ownership is a requirement for qualifying for subsidized fertilizer, and this makes it difficult for some small farmers who are tenant. The soil analysis indicated a significant decrease in the soil pH as a result of intensified agriculture. One reason is due to the intensive use of chemical fertilizers and the declining use of farmyard manure. The ineffectiveness of the extension services also influences farmers’ use of fertilizer as they are not aware of which fertilizer and how much to use. The use of fertilizer may increase yields in the short term, but in the longer term, it may worsen the food insecurity in the country.},

Applying Autoregressive-Distributed Lag Regression or ARDL bounds testing approach for analysis of co-integration between the variables, we confirm that there is a long-run relationship among the variables. Furthermore, we employ Granger non-causality tests for robustness. The findings reveal that rainfall has substantial effects on the rice yield. Specifically, a positive and significant relationship exists between rice yields and rainfall and that this relationship is unidirectional. Rainfall impacts on rice yield and holding all things constant, a 1 mm increase in rainfall increases rice yields by 0.65 percent. Given the effects of temperature on rice crops and increasing climate change vulnerabilities, agricultural scientists should focus on research and development of temperature tolerant rice varieties in the production of rice yields.},

A study was carried out to assess the impact of climate change on yield and irrigation water requirement of these cereal crops in Bhaktapur, Nepal. Laboratory and soil-plant-air-water analysis showed silt-loam being the most dominant soil type in the study area. A yield simulation model, AquaCrop, was able to simulate the crop yield with reasonable accuracy. Future (2030–2060) crop yield simulations, on forcing the Providing Regional Climates for Impacts Studies (PRECIS) based on regional circulation model simulation indicated decreased (based on HadCM3Q0 projection) and increased (based on ECHAM5 projection) yield of monsoon rice for A1B scenario, and rather stable yield (for both projection) of winter wheat. Simulation results for management strategies indicated that the crop yield was mainly constrained by water scarcity and fertility stress emphasizing the need for proper water management and fertilizer application. Similarly, a proper deficit irrigation strategy was found to be suitable to stabilize the wheat yield in the dry season. Furthermore, an increase in fertilizer application dose was more effective in fully irrigated conditions than in rainfed conditions.},

At the same time, severe environmental impacts have been incurred which not only affect future food security but also have impacts on other socio-economic aspects. The agricultural policies that have been put into practice have direct or indirect impacts on such environmental outcomes. We review the impacts of agricultural policies as well as conservation policies, their effectiveness, some unintended consequences and conﬂicts. The article concludes that technology and institutional innovation in China should emphasize more integrated sustainable development considering the agriculture–environment nexus, instead of setting incoherent and sometimes incompatible policy goals for each separate side.},

It is widely acknowledged that the impacts of climate change pose a significant threat to food production systems and the livelihoods of millions of people, particularly in vulnerable regions such as Somalia. The study was set to examine the effect of climate change on food security in Gedo, Jubaland, Somalia. This study adopted a mixed-methods research approach to investigate the effect of climate change on food security in Gedo, Jubaland, Somalia. From the study discussions the demographic profile of our respondents, highlighting its implications on our data. The agricultural practices prevalent in the region, the economic indicators that define the community’s prosperity, and the crucial indicators of food security were deliberated upon in depth. Drawing the study results, the study concluded that the tapestry of Gedo, Jubaland, Somalia, is a complex interplay of tradition, resilience, challenges, and aspirations. At the heart of this narrative is a community deeply rooted in its agricultural practices, where livestock rearing emerges not just as an occupation, but as a way of life. The reliance on traditional farming, while indicative of a rich cultural heritage, also points to opportunities for growth and modernization. Lastly from the study conclusion and findings the study recommended that embrace Modern Agricultural Practices: While traditional farming has sustained Gedo for generations, there are benefits to integrating modern techniques. Workshops and training sessions focused on sustainable farming, crop rotation, and soil conservation can lead to improved yields and better food security.},

	abstract = {Originating from the southern slope of Himalaya, the Karnali River poses a high ﬂood risk at downstream regions during the monsoon season (June to September). This paper presents comprehensive hazard mapping and risk assessments in the downstream region of the Karnali River basin for diﬀerent return-period ﬂoods, with the aid of the HEC-RAS (Hydrologic Engineering Center’s River Analysis System). The assessment was conducted on a {\textasciitilde}38 km segment of the Karnali River from Chisapani to the Nepal–India border. To perform hydrodynamic simulations, a long-term time series of instantaneous peak discharge records from the Chisapani gauging station was collected. Flooding conditions representing 2-, 5-, 10-, 50-, 100-, 200-, and 1000-year return periods (YRPs) were determined using Gumbel’s distribution. With an estimated peak discharge of up to 29,910 m3/s and the ﬂood depths up to 23 m in the 1000-YRP, the area vulnerable to ﬂooding in the study domain extends into regions on both the east and west banks of the Karnali River. Such ﬂooding in agricultural land poses a high risk to food security, which directly impacts on residents’ livelihoods. Furthermore, the simulated ﬂood in 2014 (equivalent to a 100-YRP) showed a high level of impact on physical infrastructure, aﬀecting 51 schools, 14 health facilities, 2 bus-stops, and an airport. A total of 132 km of rural–urban roads and 22 km of highways were inundated during the ﬂood. In summary, this study can support in future planning and decision-making for improved water resources management and development of ﬂood control plans on the southern slope of Himalaya.},

	abstract = {Many agricultural production areas worldwide are characterized by high variability of water supply conditions, or simply lack of water, creating a dependence on irrigation since Neolithic times. The aim of this paper is to provide an overview of the evolution of irrigation of agricultural lands worldwide, based on bibliographical research focusing on ancient water management techniques and ingenious irrigation practices and their associated land management practices. In ancient Egypt, regular ﬂooding by the Nile River meant that early agriculture probably consisted of planting seeds in soils that had been recently covered and fertilized with ﬂoodwater and silt deposits. On the other hand, in arid and semi-arid regions farmers made use of perennial springs and seasonal runoﬀ under circumstances altogether diﬀerent from the river civilizations of Mesopotamia, Egypt, India, and early dynasties in China. We review irrigation practices in all major irrigation regions through the centuries. Emphasis is given to the Bronze Age civilizations (Minoans, Egyptians, and Indus valley), pre-Columbian, civilizations from the historic times (e.g., Chinese, Hellenic, and Roman), late-Columbians (e.g., Aztecs and Incas) and Byzantines, as well as to Ottomans and Arabs. The implications and impacts of irrigation techniques on modern management of water resources, as well as on irrigated agriculture, are also considered and discussed. Finally, some current major agricultural water management challenges are outlined, concluding that ancient practices could be adapted to cope with present challenges in irrigated agriculture for increasing productivity and sustainability.},
