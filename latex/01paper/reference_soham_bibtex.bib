Several researchers have reported that rate of air temperature rise (long term trend of atmospheric warming) in Nepal is highest in the Himalayan region ({\textasciitilde} 3500 m asl or higher) compared to the Hills and Terai regions. Contrary to the results of previous researchers, however this study found that the increment of annual mean temperature is much higher in the Hills (1000 to 2000 m asl) than in the Terai and Mountain Regions. The temperature lapse rate in a wide altitudinal range of Nepal (70 to 5050 m asl) is -5.65 °C km-1. Warming rates in Terai and Trans-Himalayas (Jomsom) are 0.024 and 0.029 °C/year respectively.},

	abstract = {There is a general agreement that Climate Change impacting Nepal rather disproportionately compared to its size and its own meagre contribution of the green house gases. However, given its location between two rapidly growing economies of India and China, Nepal cannot escape the rapidly increasing influence of climate and global changes. The rapidly retreating glaciers (average retreat of more than 30 m/year), rapid rise in temperature ({\textgreater}0.06OC), erratic rainfalls and increase in frequency of extreme events such as floods and drought like situation are some of the effects Nepal is facing during the last few years. Most of the big rivers of Nepal are glacier-fed and its main resources of water and hydroelectricity will be seriously affected due to the ongoing changes in glacier reserves, snowfall and natural hazards. Nepal has to prepare itself to try and mitigate these effects if possible and if not adapt to them to reduce their impacts on our lives and livelihoods. Nepal is largely a mountainous country and current indications are that the mountain regions are more vulnerable due to increased warming trends as well as extreme changes in altitude over small distances. These alarming trends not only make Nepal’s major sectors of economy such as agriculture, tourism and energy more vulnerable but also endanger the health, safety and wellbeing of Nepali people. Biodiversity - the other important resources of Nepal is also being affected as invasive species will spread fast and useful medicinal, food and nutrition related plants may disappear. Climate change is becoming already dangerous to our survival and we have to do everything possible to prevent it being catastrophic to us. The globally accepted strategy to contain disastrous climate change impacts is Adaptation and Mitigation. For a least developed country such as Nepal, adaptation should be the priority. Nepal is currently preparing National Action Plan on Adaptation (NAPA) which should be made as comprehensive and topical as possible. Well coordinated, quick and serious implementation of NAPA will be extremely important to mitigate and adapt to the growing impacts of climate change in Nepal. Nepal’s central location in the Himalaya portends the fact that it is the prime target country of climate change impacts and calls for it to play a leadership role at least in showing political will and playing a responsible role in global events such as the COP-15 at Copenhagen.},

	abstract = {Investigating the changes in the extreme temperature indices is crucial for the assessment of climate change and to recommend practical adaptation strategies particularly in countries like Nepal, which is highly prone to the impacts of extreme climatic events. This study analyses the mean temperatures and the changes of extreme temperature indices at 25 stations located in different physiographic regions in Nepal at monthly and annual time scales for 1986–2015. Ten extreme temperature indices recommended by ETCCDI are selected and examined. Quality control is first conducted for original daily maximum and minimum temperature data. In Nepal, it is warming in general with maximum temperature (0.04C year−1) increasing faster than minimum temperature (0.02C year−1) on countrywide average which is contrary to the changes in the Tibetan Plateau and its surroundings and the global average. The changes in extreme temperatures are spatiotemporally heterogeneous and unique. Annually, cold extremes increase but the percentage of days below 10th percentile becomes less frequent. Terai and Siwalik plain regions show negative annual trends in cold indices (TNn and TXn), but mixed changes in other extreme indices. There are strong correlations between the trends of maximum temperature-related variables and elevation. This analysis also adds the evidence of pronounced warming in higher elevation only for daytime extreme temperatures but not for temperature minima in Nepal which differs from the other studies around the world. This study also reveals that December and January tend to have colder days in the Terai. However, summer months are getting hotter in each region across the country. Kathmandu, the most urbanized city in Nepal shows a significant increase in minimum temperature (Tmin) and minimum Tmin (TNn) indicating the influence of urbanization in temperature change - an urban heat island effect.},

	abstract = {Existing climate projections and impact assessments in Nepal only consider a limited number of generic climate indices such as means. Few studies have explored climate extremes and their sectoral implications. This study evaluates future scenarios of extreme climate indices from the list of the Expert Team on Sector-specific Climate Indices (ETSCI) and their sectoral implications in the Karnali Basin in western Nepal. First, future projections of 26 climate indices relevant to six climate-sensitive sectors in Karnali are made for the near (2021–2045), mid (2046–2070), and far (2071–2095) future for lowand high-emission scenarios (RCP4.5 and RCP8.5, respectively) using bias-corrected ensembles of 19 regional climate models from the COordinated Regional Downscaling EXperiment for South Asia (CORDEX-SA). Second, a qualitative analysis based on expert interviews and a literature review on the impact of the projected climate extremes on the climate-sensitive sectors is undertaken. Both the temperature and precipitation patterns are projected to deviate significantly from the historical reference already from the near future with increased occurrences of extreme events. Winter in the highlands is expected to become warmer and dryer. The hot and wet tropical summer in the lowlands will become hotter with longer warm spells and fewer cold days. Low-intensity precipitation events will decline, but the magnitude and frequency of extreme precipitation events will increase. The compounding effects of the increase in extreme temperature and precipitation events will have largely negative implications for the six climate-sensitive sectors considered here.},

	abstract = {The impacts of natural hazards are typically measured in terms of loss of human lives and economic damage, and recent studies demonstrate that deaths attributed to natural hazards have increased. Using the publicly available DesInventar database, we examined spatial and temporal patterns of natural hazard mortality from 1971 to 2011 at the district and village levels of Nepal and identified natural hazards that contributed most to mortality. Spatial clusters of mortality at the district and village levels were detected using local and global spatial autocorrelation measures (Moran’s I). Landslides (41.91\%) and floods (32.52\%) accounted for approximately three quarters of natural hazard mortalities over the study period. A Global Moran’s I test positively confirmed clustering at both the district (0.199, p {\textless} .001) and village (0.256, p {\textless} .001) levels, whereas a Local Moran’s I test further detected clustering in the central and terai regions, where dynamic geologic and geomorphic processes combined with human-environment interaction constitute major risk factors. A better understanding of multihazard mortality patterns across geographic landscapes and time has the potential to aid policy makers, planners, and local officers to more efficiently allocate scarce capital and human resources to reduce mortality.},

Focus Group Discussions (FGD) were organized to collect and analyze vulnerability contexts on climate change and its impact on various sectors like, agriculture, forest, livestock, biodiversity, infrastructure, human casualties and water sources. Similarly, information on available service providers and their contribution was garnered through secondary sources. Local communities are facing these changes over the time and adapting strategies as per their own traditional knowledge, skills and information. Most of these strategies are biodiversity friendly, economically viable and socially acceptable. However, these innovative steps should be shared for larger scale dissemination after validating with scientific review and justifications.},

Agriculture sector policies, periodic plans and relevant action plans and projects were reviewed in connection to consultatively speculated vulnerabilities and impacts of climate change to appraise the country's preparedness and strength for the adaptation. The policy statements are broad enough to cover majority of vulnerability issues. And they lack optimum research need and resource availability considerations and clear pathways towards capacitating vulnerable communities to cope with the changing situations.

Low resolution data of minimum and maximum temperature obtained from the selected GCMs was downscaled using the statistical downscaling model Long Ashton Research Station Weather Generator (LARS-WG) for ten stations located in two physiographic regions of the study area: the Middle Mountains (1500–2700 m) and the Siwalik Hills (700–1500 m). The projected temperature and differences in projections among individual GCM projections for changes in the mean value of seasonal and annual Tmin and Tmax are presented for three future periods: 2011–2030 (2020s), 2046–2065 (2055s) and 2080–2099 (2090s). We also analyzed the baseline period and future Tmin and Tmax data through seven indices, as recommended by the Expert Team on Climate Change Detection, Monitoring and Indices (ETCCDMI). Results show that the LARS-WG model performs well when downscaling Tmin and Tmax. An increase in seasonal as well as mean annual minimum and maximum temperature is projected for all three future periods. Projected warming, as well as the differences among projections from different GCMs, increases with time for each of the three scenarios. The cold years during the 2055s and 2090s are expected to be hotter than the hot years during the baseline period. The increase in temperature, as well as the range of uncertainty, is expected to be higher in the Mountains than in the Hills. The number of summer days and tropical nights is expected to increase during all three future periods. The temperature of the coldest day, coldest night, warmest day and warmest night is also expected to increase in both the regions during all three future periods.},

The present study discusses temperature and precipitation extremes in Kashmir Valley using observational data from six meteorological stations. An Expert Team on Climate Change Detection and Indices (ETCCDI) (http://etccdi.paciﬁcclimate.org/) provides 25 extreme climate indices (15 for temperature and 10 for precipitation) to be used. The absolute extreme temperature indices (TXx, TXn, TNx, and TNn) exhibit increasing tendencies, according to the ﬁndings. The number of changes witnessed in daily maximum temperature was greater than the daily minimum temperature which was manifested by increasing diurnal temperature range (DTR; 0.012 °C/year). These changes in extremes have impacts that pose a threat to agriculture, snow day and cover, glaciers, water resources, ecosystem services, etc. of the study region. The region is undergoing signiﬁcant urban and land system changes making it further vulnerable to natural hazards. The ﬁndings are expected to further augment the hazard and risk analysis and the necessary disaster risk reduction measures for climate-related disasters in the region. These analyses will be helpful for the development of strategies for climate risk management in Kashmir.},

	abstract = {The impact of climate change on farmers’ livelihoods has been observed in various forms at the local and regional scales. It is well known that the Himalayas region is affected by climate change, as reﬂected in the basic knowledge of farmers in the region. A questionnaire-based survey involving a total of 747 households was conducted to gather information on climate change and its impact, where the survey addressed four physiographic regions of the trans-boundary Koshi River Basin (KRB). Moreover, climatic data were used to calculate climatic trends between 1980 and 2018. The Mann–Kendall trend test was performed and the Sen’s slope calculated to analyze the inter-annual climatic trends over time. The survey noted that, for the basin, there was an increase in temperature, climate-induced diseases of crops, an increase in the frequency of pests as well as drought and ﬂoods and a decrease in rainfall, all which are strong indicators of climate change. It was perceived that these indicators had adverse impacts on crop production (89.4\%), human health (82.5\%), livestock (68.7\%) and vegetation (52.1\%). The observed climatic trends for all the physiographic regions included an increasing temperature trend and a decreasing rainfall trend. The rate of change varied according to each region, hence strongly supporting the farmers’ local knowledge of climate change. The highest increasing trend of temperature noted in the hill region at 0.0975 ◦C/a (p = 0.0002) and sharpest decreasing trend of rainfall in the mountain region by −10.424 mm/a (p = 0.016) between 1980 and 2018. Formulation of suitable adaptation strategies according to physiographic region can minimize the impact of climate change. New adaptation strategies proposed include the introduction of infrastructure for irrigation systems, the development of crop seeds that are more tolerant to drought, pests and disease tolerance, and the construction of local hospitals for the beneﬁt of farming communities.},

In this study, observed data for the period 1988 to 2010 of high-altitude regions viz. Annapurna, Langtang and Khumbu of Nepal were used. The Coupled Global Climate Model (CGCM3) for A1B Special Report of Emissions Scenarios (SRES) over the period 2001 to 2060 were used to determine scenarios. Statistical Downscaling Model (SDSM) software was used to downscale precipitation and temperature data at Modi, Langtang and DudhKoshi river basins. The simulated precipitation and temperature were corrected for bias before implementing in the conceptual rainfall-runoff model HydraologiskaByransVattenbalansavde (HBV) for hydrological response analysis. In the HVB-light 3.0, Groups Algorithms Programming (GAP) optimization approach and calibration was used to obtain several parameter sets which were finally reproduced to observe the stream flow. The CGCM3 model projects increasing trends in annual as well as seasonal precipitations except in summer (JJAS) during 2001-2060 for A1B SERS emission scenarios over three sites under investigation. The model projects warmer days in every season of entire period from 2001 to 2060. These warming trends are higher in maximum than in minimum temperatures throughout the year, which indicate increasing trend of daily temperature ranges as the greenhouse effect increases.Further, trends of the post-monsoon (ON) temperature is much cooler compared to remaining three seasons (months) over all three sites. In addition, decreasing trends in summer discharge at Langtang Khola and increasing in Modi Khola and DudhKoshi river basin are evident. Among all basinsthe flow regime is more pronounced during later parts of the future decades as compare topreceedingdecades.},

            The Third Pole (TP) is experiencing rapid warming and is currently in its warmest period in the past 2,000 years. This paper reviews the latest development in multidisciplinary TP research associated with this warming. The rapid warming facilitates intense and broad glacier melt over most of the TP, although some glaciers in the northwest are advancing. By heating the atmosphere and reducing snow/ice albedo, aerosols also contribute to the glaciers melting. Glacier melt is accompanied by lake expansion and intensification of the water cycle over the TP. Precipitation has increased over the eastern and northwestern TP. Meanwhile, the TP is greening and most regions are experiencing advancing phenological trends, although over the southwest there is a spring phenological delay mainly in response to the recent decline in spring precipitation. Atmospheric and terrestrial thermal and dynamical processes over the TP affect the Asian monsoon at different scales. Recent evidence indicates substantial roles that mesoscale convective systems play in the TP’s precipitation as well as an association between soil moisture anomalies in the TP and the Indian monsoon. Moreover, an increase in geohazard events has been associated with recent environmental changes, some of which have had catastrophic consequences caused by glacial lake outbursts and landslides. Active debris flows are growing in both frequency of occurrences and spatial scale. Meanwhile, new types of disasters, such as the twin ice avalanches in Ali in 2016, are now appearing in the region. Adaptation and mitigation measures should be taken to help societies’ preparation for future environmental challenges. Some key issues for future TP studies are also discussed.},

	abstract = {Study of spatiotemporal dynamics of temperature is vital to assess changes in climate, especially in the Himalayan region where livelihoods of billions of people living downstream depends on water coming from the melting of snow and glacier ice. To this end, temperature trend analysis is carried out in Narayani river basin, a major river basin of Nepal characterized by three climatic regions: tropical, subtropical and alpine. Temperature data from six stations located within the basin were analyzed. The elevation of these stations ranges from 460 to 3800 m a.s.l. and the time period of available temperature data ranges from 1960–2015. Multiple regression and empirical mode decomposition (EMD) methods were applied to ﬁll in missing data and to detect trends. Annual as well as seasonal trends were analyzed and a Mann-Kendall test was employed to test the statistical signiﬁcance of detected trends. Results indicate signiﬁcant cooling trends before 1970s, and warming trends after 1970s in the majority of the stations. The warming trends range from 0.028 ◦C year−1 to 0.035 ◦C year−1 with a mean increasing trend of 0.03 ◦C year−1 after 1971. Seasonal trends show highest warming trends in the monsoon season followed by winter, pre-monsoon, and the post-monsoon season. However, difference in warming rates between different seasons was not signiﬁcant. An average temperature lapse rate of −0.006 ◦C m−1 with the steepest value (−0.0064 ◦C m−1) in pre-monsoon season and least negative (−0.0052 ◦C m−1) in winter season was observed for this basin. A comparative analysis of the gap-ﬁlled data with freely available global climate datasets shows reasonable correlation thus conﬁrming the suitability of the gap ﬁlling methods.},

The annual, seasonal and monthly changes in different regions of India were investigated to see the climate change in different parts of the country, and the net excess or deficit of rainfall and temperature in India was obtained. Statistical non-parametric tests were performed to see the trend magnitude with the Mann-Kendall (MK) test and Sen’s slope. Mann-Whitney-Pettitt (MWP) test was used for probable break point detection in the series, and change percentage was calculated over 30 sub-divisions and 7 broad regions. The results indicate decreasing annual and monsoon rainfall of India in most of the sub-divisions, and temperature fluctuations were observed in all the places. Temperatures (minimum, maximum and mean) were showing a significant increase, particularly in the winter and post-monsoon time. Wide variation was noticed all over India in the case of the minimum temperature. Variation was also observed at different spatial scales of sub-divisions and regions. This study gives the net impact of climate change in India which shows net excess of temperature and net deficit of rainfall.},

	abstract = {Understanding the potential impact of climate change on the hydrological regime in the Himalayan region is of great importance for sustainable water resources management. This study assessed the historic and projected climate trends in the Koshi river basin using statistical analysis. The hydrological characteristics and the contribution of different runoff components under present and projected future conditions were investigated in the Dudh Koshi sub-basin using the J2000 model. Data for 1995 to 2096 from the Providing REgional Climates for Impacts Studies (PRECIS) regional climate model were used in the J2000 model to project the impact of climate change under the A1B climate scenario in mid-century (2040–2050) and late-century (2086–2096), compared to baseline (2000–2010). Present climate showed an increase in average temperature in the river basin at a rate of 0.058 °C/year for maximum temperature and 0.014 °C/year for minimum temperature over the past forty years. The model simulation of the hydrological regime from 1985 to1997 was satisfactory. The average annual contribution of snow and glacier melt to total discharge was about 34\%, whereas it was 63\% in the pre-monsoon season (March to May). The projected future results from the model indicate a 13\% increase in annual discharge by mid-century followed by a slight decrease; and a 16\% increase in evapotranspiration by the end of the century. Snowfall is projected to decrease substantially due to the rise in temperature, the basin will lose snow storage capacity, and there will be a marked decrease in snowmelt runoff from non-glaciated areas. In contrast, melt from glaciated areas will increase up to mid-century and start decreasing thereafter. The model results suggest that snowfall pattern, snowmelt, discharge, and evaporation are all sensitive to the effects of climate change.},

	abstract = {The Koshi river basin is a sub-basin of the Ganges shared among China, Nepal, and India. The river system has a high potential for investment in hydropower development and for irrigation in downstream areas. The upper part of the basin contains a substantial reserve of freshwater in the form of snow and glaciers. Climate variability, climate change, and climate extremes might impact on these reserves, and in turn impact on systems that support livelihoods, such as agriculture, biodiversity and related ecosystem services. Climatological variability and trends over the Koshi river basin were studied using RClimDex. Daily temperature data (20 stations) and precipitation data (50 stations) from 1975 to 2010 were used in the analysis. The results show that the frequency and intensity of weather extremes are increasing. The daily maximum temperature (TXx) increased by 0.1 ∘C decade−1 on average between 1975 and 2010 and the minimum (TNn) by 0.3 ∘C decade−1. The number of warm nights increased at all stations. Most of the extreme temperature indices showed a consistently different pattern in the mountains than in the Indo-Gangetic plains, although not all results were statistically significant. The warm days (TX90p), warm nights (TN90p), warm spell duration (WSDI), and diurnal temperature range (DTR) increased at most of the mountain stations; whereas monthly maximum and minimum values of daily maximum temperature, TX90p, cool nights (TN10p), WSDI, cold spell duration indicator (CSDI), DTR decreased at the stations in the Indo-Gangetic plains, while the number of cold days increased. There was an increase in total annual rainfall and rainfall intensity, although no clear long-term linear trend, whereas the number of consecutive dry days increased at almost all stations. The results indicate that the risk of extreme climate events over the basin is increasing, which will increase people’s vulnerability and has strong policy implications.},

	abstract = {Analyses of maximum temperature data from 49 stations in Nepal for the period 1971–94 reveal warming trends after 1977 ranging from 0.06Њ to 0.12ЊC yrϪ1 in most of the Middle Mountain and Himalayan regions, while the Siwalik and Terai (southern plains) regions show warming trends less than 0.03ЊC yrϪ1. The subset of records (14 stations) extending back to the early 1960s suggests that the recent warming trends were preceded by similar widespread cooling trends. Distributions of seasonal and annual temperature trends show high rates of warming in the high-elevation regions of the country (Middle Mountains and Himalaya), while low warming or even cooling trends were found in the southern regions. This is attributed to the sensitivity of mountainous regions to climate changes. The seasonal temperature trends and spatial distribution of temperature trends also highlight the inﬂuence of monsoon circulation.},
