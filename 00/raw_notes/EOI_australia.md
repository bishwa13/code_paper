# Climate Change and Agricultural Livelihoods in Nepal: Impacts, Adaptation, and Sustainable Practices

Climate change is increasingly affecting agricultural livelihoods in Nepal, where agriculture provides employment and sustenance for the majority of the population. Changes in temperature, rainfall patterns, and the frequency of extreme weather events threaten crop yields, food security, and the economic stability of rural communities. Agriculture-dependent households, particularly in vulnerable regions like Janaki Rural Municipality, face rising challenges from erratic rainfall, droughts, and floods, making adaptive responses crucial for sustaining their livelihoods.

By assessing the broader relationship between climate change and agricultural livelihoods, this research aims to identify and analyze adaptive strategies and sustainable practices that can mitigate risks to farming communities and support policy initiatives for resilient agricultural development.

## **Research Questions**

1. **Impacts of Climate Change on Agriculture and Livelihoods**
   - How are changing temperature patterns, rainfall variability, and extreme weather events affecting agricultural productivity, water resources, and livelihoods in rural Nepal?
   - What are the observed impacts of climate change on soil quality, forest products, and human health, and how do these effects vary across different regions?

2. **Adaptation Strategies and Practices**
   - What climate adaptation practices have local communities adopted to mitigate impacts on agriculture, and how effective are these practices in sustaining livelihood security?
   - What role do natural hazards (e.g., landslides, invasive species, pests) play in shaping adaptation strategies, and what are the key challenges communities face in implementing these strategies?

3. **Institutional and Policy Support for Adaptation**
   - How can local and national institutions effectively support climate adaptation, and what are the primary governance and capacity-building needs for enhanced climate resilience in rural communities?
   - What specific policies, resources, and infrastructure (e.g., water management, agricultural diversification) are required to address climate changeâ€™s long-term impacts on food security and rural economies?

4. **Sustainable Agricultural and Resilience-Building Practices**
   - How can sustainable agricultural practices and adaptive policies improve resilience for smallholder farmers, particularly in mountain regions?
   - What are the critical requirements for integrated adaptation planning that address both community resilience and national food security in the face of climate variability?
