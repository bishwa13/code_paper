### 1st Inquiry

Q: I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to inquire about the Higher Degree Research programs offered by your university, specifically the Master of Philosophy (Environmental Science) and Master by Research programs.

I have completed my Master's degree in Environmental Science from Tribhuvan University, Nepal, and I am keen to further my academic journey in this field. I would appreciate it if you could provide me with details regarding the application process, eligibility criteria, and any specific procedures I need to follow to apply for these programs.

Additionally, I would be grateful if you could share the contact details of someone at the university who can guide me through the application process and provide further assistance.

Thank you for your time and support. I look forward to your response.
