Why We Need to Write an Expression of Interest (EOI)
An Expression of Interest (EOI) is an essential part of applying to a Master's by Research program. It serves as a formal document where you present your case to the admissions committee, helping them evaluate your suitability for the program. Here’s why writing an EOI is necessary:
Demonstrating Research Alignment: The EOI allows you to show how your research interests match the university’s strengths and priorities. Universities need to see that your project fits within their expertise and resources.

Showcasing Research Potential: It’s your chance to prove you can develop a clear, feasible research question, outline a methodology, and explain why your study matters. This helps the committee assess your ability to succeed in a research-focused program.

Establishing Academic Fit: Through the EOI, you can highlight your academic background and relevant experience, showing you’re prepared for advanced research.

Communicating Motivation and Goals: The EOI lets you explain why you’re passionate about your research area and how it ties into your future career plans, demonstrating your commitment.

Identifying Potential Supervisors: Many programs ask you to suggest supervisors in the EOI. This shows you’ve researched the faculty and can identify experts who align with your project.

In short, the EOI is your opportunity to convince the university that you’re a strong candidate with a well-thought-out research plan, making it a critical step in the application process.
Fundamental Questions to Answer in an EOI
To create a solid EOI, you should address these key questions. These cover the basics that admissions committees expect:
What is your research question or problem?
Clearly define the focus of your proposed research. For example, “I aim to investigate how renewable energy adoption impacts rural economies.”

Why is this research important?
Explain the significance of your study and its potential impact. For instance, “This research could inform sustainable development policies in underserved regions.”

What is your proposed methodology?
Outline your approach, including how you’ll collect and analyze data. For example, “I will use a mixed-methods approach, combining surveys with statistical analysis.”

What is your academic background and relevant experience?
Highlight your qualifications, such as your degree, coursework, or prior research, that prepare you for this project. For example, “My undergraduate thesis on energy policy equipped me with relevant analytical skills.”

Why are you interested in this university and program?
Show you’ve researched the institution and explain how its resources or faculty align with your goals. For example, “This university’s focus on sustainability studies complements my research interests.”
