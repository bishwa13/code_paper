### Research Thesis Vision

My journey toward sustainable agriculture research began in Banke, Nepal—a region where agriculture is not only the mainstay of the economy but also the very fabric of daily life. Growing up in Terai Region of Nepal, I witnessed firsthand the adverse effects of climatic extremes—from severe flooding to prolonged droughts—which have repeatedly disrupted local farming practices. These experiences ignited my passion for understanding the complex interplay between climate change and agricultural productivity.During my Master of Science in Environmental Science, I focused on the effects of climatic variability and soil nutrient on crop production, employing statistical models to reveal how various factors such as rainfall, soil quality, and farming practices interconnect. However, traditional methods alone could not fully capture the dynamic challenges faced by communities. This realization led me to explore the potential of disciplines to not only analyze but also actively solve real-world agricultural issues. The current landscape of education underscores the transformative power of integrating  methodologies into learning environments. Academic research, highlights how technology-enhanced education can empower communities to tackle environmental challenges effectively. My proposed research aims to build on these insights by leveraging digital technologies such as Remote Sensing, GIS, machine learning and data analysis to develop predictive models for climate impacts on agriculture. The vision is to create an educational framework that delivers both theoretical and practical knowledge, enabling farmers and community stakeholders to develop policy and implement adaptive strategies. Research indicates that education improves adaptive capacity and the ability to adjust to climate impacts. Furthermore, integrating international learning experiences into sustainable agriculture education programs can enhance students' global awareness and problem-solving skills.By aligning cutting-edge research with robust STEM education, this project seeks to bridge the divide between scientific inquiry and practical application. The research will not only expand the academic discourse on sustainable agriculture  but also provide actionable insights for policymakers and local communities, fostering an environment where science and education jointly drive sustainable development.

### Research Thesis Vision

My journey towards a focused interest in sustainable agriculture and climate change adaptation has been deeply shaped by my upbringing in Banke, Nepal, a region where the rhythm of life is intrinsically linked to agricultural practices. Growing up amidst vast croplands, I have witnessed firsthand the evolving patterns of cultivation, the fluctuating fortunes of agricultural productivity, and the increasing encroachment upon arable land. However, it was the profound impact of climatic disasters that truly ignited a lifelong passion to understand and address the challenges facing Nepal's agricultural sector. I vividly recall the devastating floods that inundated Banke and surrounding areas during my childhood, a stark reminder of the vulnerability of our agricultural systems to extreme weather events. Subsequent occurrences of inundation, droughts, and erratic monsoons have further underscored the fragility of crop productivity in the face of a changing climate.Agriculture forms the backbone of Nepal's economy, engaging a significant majority of the population and contributing substantially to the nation's GDP.22 However, this sector is increasingly threatened by the intensifying impacts of climate change, which manifest as rising temperatures, altered precipitation patterns, and a greater frequency of extreme weather events like floods and droughts.25 These changes not only impact crop yields and livestock health but also pose significant threats to food security and the livelihoods of countless families who depend on agriculture.25 Sustainable agriculture offers a promising pathway to mitigate these vulnerabilities by promoting practices that enhance soil health, conserve water resources, reduce reliance on harmful chemicals, and ultimately build more resilient farming systems.21My academic background in Environmental Science, culminating in a Master's thesis focused on "The Role of Climate Change on Crop Production and Other Factors in Janaki Rural Municipality, Banke, Nepal," has provided me with a solid foundation in understanding these complex relationships. Through statistical modeling, I analyzed the intricate connections between crop yields and climatic factors in my locality, also examining the influence of pests, soil nutrients, fertilizer inputs, irrigation, and land-use change.
