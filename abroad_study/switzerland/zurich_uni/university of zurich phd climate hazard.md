# Motivation Letter
I am a graduate student of Masters in environmental science from College of Applied Sciences Nepal Tribhuvan University, passed on April of 2024. I am working as freelancer especially focusing on preparation of EIA, IEE and report preparation with various organizations and companies, Title of my masters thesis is "Impact of Climate Change on Paddy Production in the Koshi Basin, Nepal " and paper is "Spatial and Temporal Variations of Surface Air Temperature (1962â€“2022) across Physiographic Regions in the Koshi Basin, Nepal". 
Being in the himalayan region Nepal faces numerous climate related hazard such as GlOFs, debris flows and avalanche. It is important to understand howwarming destablizes slopes and increases hazard frequency. Climate change is projected to create new hazards such as Glacier retreat and permafrost thaw along with decreasing stability of mountain slopes and increase the number and area of glacier lakes. I believe To understand the risk it is necessary to use various probabilistic and uncertainty methods such as Monte Carlo or Bayesian methods to hazard assessment. I know To find out spatial variation of such hazard across regions and its extent with the use of GIS and Remotesensing to process satellite imagery and sometimes use of drons to map terrain and detect changes is very practically useful. For such task i am familiar with Python (or R) for data sensitivity and uncertainty analysis and modeling. Along with programming i am familiar with SDSM, HEC-HMS, HEC-RAS, QGIS/ArcGIS and their APIs to work in team. 

I am familier with Google Eart Engine and HazMapper and i find them to useful for detecting post-diaster changes (fires, landslides, floods) additionally for mapping hazards in real time. To prepare maps for visualization i am familiar with Leaflet, Open Street Maps to showcase multi-layer maps and time-lapse imagery.

I have travelled various himalayan terrain for various field work, studies and surveys. I am excited about the opportunity to travel and study the Koshi Basin and I am being from the same Basin. I find it extremly meaningful, as i always wanted to use my capabilities for betterment of my locality. Thats why i did my masters thesis in Koshi Basin climate change and its impact on agriculture, and i have also published a paper on Society of hydrologists and Metrologists. One of the exciting field trip of mine was Sindhupalchok for study of Landslide hazard study where i was a part of team and produced a landslide susptibility map and develop a policy and financial planning suggestion for local government.
