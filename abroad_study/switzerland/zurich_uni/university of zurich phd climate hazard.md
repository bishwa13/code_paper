# Motivation Letter
Dear Members of the Selection Committee,
Growing up in high hills of Nepal’s Koshi Basin, I watched its waters both nurture and devastate the communities I call home. Disasters took lives, destroyed livelihoods. Floods swept away crops, landslides reshaped hillsides, and shifting climates tested the resilience of farmers who fed my village. These experiences ignited a fire in me—a determination to understand and mitigate the hazards threatening my region. I am writing to express my deep enthusiasm for the PhD position in multi-hazard risk modelling and assessment in the Himalaya of Nepal, co-hosted by the University of Zurich and Tribhuvan University. With my Master’s in Environmental Science from the College of Applied Sciences-Nepal, Tribhuvan University (April 2024), and a heart rooted in the Himalayas, I am eager to contribute to this vital project.
My academic journey began with a Master’s thesis exploring climate change impacts on paddy production in the Koshi Basin. Diving into data, I uncovered how rising temperatures and erratic rains disrupt local agriculture, threatening livelihoods. This work, coupled with a co-authored study on historical temperature trends in the Basin, sharpened my skills in climate data analysis and scientific writing. These experiences taught me that numbers tell stories—of struggling farmers, changing landscapes, and the urgent need for solutions.
Technical tools have become my allies in this mission. I wield Python and R to analyze data and build models, while GIS platforms like QGIS and ArcGIS help me map hazards with precision. I’ve used HEC-HMS and HEC-RAS to simulate flood scenarios, SDSM to downscale climate projections, and remote sensing tools like Google Earth Engine and HazMapper to process satellite data. These skills equip me to develop probabilistic models for cascading hazards—like glacial lake outburst floods or ice-rock avalanches—and integrate them with flood and landslide scenarios for comprehensive risk assessment.
My fields experiences bring these tools to life. Teaching Hydrological Modelling to Master’s students at the College of Applied Sciences, I learned to distill complex concepts into practical insights, inspiring others as I was once inspired. In Sindhupalchok district, I trekked rugged slopes for a landslide assessment, collecting data to create a GIS-based susceptibility map. Presenting this map, along with mitigation strategies and financial plans, to local government officials, I saw how science could empower communities. My freelance work in environmental impact assessments further honed my ability to translate technical findings into actionable guidance for governments, businesses, and communities. These moments—blending modelling, fieldwork, and stakeholder collaboration—shaped my interdisciplinary lens and commitment to impactful research.
The Koshi Basin is more than a study area; it’s my home. Its rivers and mountains are part of me, driving my passion for disaster risk reduction. This project’s focus on integrating local and indigenous knowledge into hazard models resonates deeply with me. I’ve seen how community wisdom—like elders’ tales of past floods—complements scientific models. Fluent in Nepali and English, I’m ready to bridge global research with local needs in this Swiss-Nepal collaboration. I’m particularly excited to develop early warning systems, real time hazard modelling, risk management strategies and decision making tools for the Koshi, aligning with my dream of building resilient Himalayan communities.

Teaching myself Latex and Python was one of the transformative journey. Python that could transform raw data into insight and ideas into reality, and Latex to craft polished scientific documents. It didn't stop there, I am exploring API integration, use of Google Earth Engine, Leaflet, OpenStreetMap and Hazmapper. To collaborate effectively, I taught myself Git, embracing version control to stramline teamwork and track every steps of my projects. These skills, honed through persistence and passion, empower me to tackle real-world problems with precision and creativity, ready to contribute to cutting-edge research.


I am confident that my willingness to learn and explore new things, academic foundation, technical expertise, fieldwork experience, and personal connection to the region make me a strong fit for this project. I aspire to contribute to the scientific community by advancing knowledge, designing remedial measures, and strengthening disaster preparedness to protect the people and wealth of the Koshi Basin. Thank you for considering my application. I would be honored to discuss my vision, potential, and fit for this role in an interview, sharing how I can help safeguard our planet’s future, one community at a time.

Yours sincerely,
Bishwa Prakash Puri
